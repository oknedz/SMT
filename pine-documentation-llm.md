if bar_index >= 10
    a := close
plot(a)
// INCORRECT
// Trying to test the preceding bar's `close` for `na`.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("syminfo simple")
//@variable A table containing information about a company's employees, shareholders, and shares.
var result_table = table.new(position = position.top_right, columns = 2, rows = 5, border_width = 1)
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Add header cells
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 0, row = 0, text = "name")
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 1, row = 0, text = "value")
    // Add employee info cells.
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 0, row = 1, text = "employees")
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 1, row = 1, text = str.tostring(syminfo.employees))
    // Add shareholder cells.
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 0, row = 2, text = "shareholders")
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 1, row = 2, text = str.tostring(syminfo.shareholders))
    // Add float shares outstanding cells.
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 0, row = 3, text = "shares_outstanding_float")
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 1, row = 3, text = str.tostring(syminfo.shares_outstanding_float))
    // Add total shares outstanding cells.
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 0, row = 4, text = "shares_outstanding_total")
    table.cell(table_id = result_table, column = 1, row = 4, text = str.tostring(syminfo.shares_outstanding_total))
See also
syminfo.shareholders
syminfo.shares_outstanding_float
syminfo.shares_outstanding_total
syminfo.expiration_date
A UNIX timestamp representing the start of the last day of the current futures contract. This variable is only compatible with non-continuous futures symbols. On other symbols, it returns na.
```

### Type

`simple int`

## syminfo.industry

Returns the industry of the symbol, or na if the symbol has no industry. Example: "Internet Software/Services", "Packaged software", "Integrated Oil", "Motor Vehicles", etc. These are the same values one can see in the chart's "Symbol info" window.

### Type

`simple string`

### Remarks

A sector is a broad section of the economy. An industry is a narrower classification. NASDAQ:CAT (Caterpillar, Inc.) for example, belongs to the "Producer Manufacturing" sector and the "Trucks/Construction/Farm Machinery" industry.

## syminfo.main_tickerid

A ticker identifier representing the current chart's symbol. The value contains an exchange prefix and a symbol name, separated by a colon (e.g., "NASDAQ:AAPL"). It can also include information about data modifications such as dividend adjustment, non-standard chart type, currency conversion, etc. Unlike syminfo.tickerid, this variable's value does not change when used in the expression argument of a request.*() function call.

### Type

`simple string`

## ticker.new()
The smallest amount of the current symbol that can be traded. This limit is set by the exchange. For cryptocurrencies, it is often less than 1 token. For most other types of asset, it is often 1.

### Type

`simple float`

## syminfo.mintick
- **`Returns a whole number used to calculate the smallest increment between a symbol's price movements`** (syminfo.mintick). It is the numerator in the syminfo.mintick formula: syminfo.minmove / syminfo.pricescale = syminfo.mintick.

### Type

`simple int`

## ticker.new()
Min tick value for the current symbol.

### Type

`simple float`

## syminfo.pointvalue
The chart price of a security multiplied by the point value equals the actual price of the traded security.

For all types of security except futures, the point value is usually equal to 1 and can therefore be ignored. For futures, the prices shown on the chart are either the cost of a single futures contract, in which case the point value is 1, or the price of a single unit of the underlying commodity, in which case the point value represents the number of units included in a single contract.

For example, the price of the "COMEX:GC1!" gold futures chart reflects the price of a single troy ounce of gold. However, a single GC futures contract comprises 100 troy ounces, as defined by the COMEX exchange. So when the price on the "GC1!" chart is 2000 USD, a single contract costs 2000 USD * 100 troy ounces = 200,000 USD. This calculation is important in backtesting, because the strategy engine takes the point value into account, and does not open a position if there is not enough capital.

The point value is also displayed in the Security Info window for a given asset.

### Type

`simple float`

## syminfo.mintick
Prefix of current symbol name (i.e. for 'CME_EOD:TICKER' prefix is 'CME_EOD').

### Type

`simple string`

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("syminfo.prefix")
// If current chart symbol is 'BATS:MSFT' then syminfo.prefix is 'BATS'.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    label.new(bar_index, high, text=syminfo.prefix)
See also
syminfo.ticker
syminfo.tickerid
syminfo.pricescale
Returns a whole number used to calculate the smallest increment between a symbol's price movements (syminfo.mintick). It is the denominator in the syminfo.mintick formula: syminfo.minmove / syminfo.pricescale = syminfo.mintick.
```

### Type

`simple int`

## ticker.new()
The number of analysts who gave the current symbol a "Buy" rating.

### Type

`series int`

## syminfo.target_price_average
Symbol name without exchange prefix, e.g. 'MSFT'.

### Type

`simple string`

## syminfo.tickerid
A ticker identifier representing the chart's symbol or a requested symbol, depending on how the script uses it. The variable's value represents a requested dataset's ticker ID when used in the expression argument of a request.*() function call. Otherwise, it represents the chart's ticker ID. The value contains an exchange prefix and a symbol name, separated by a colon (e.g., "NASDAQ:AAPL"). It can also include information about data modifications such as dividend adjustment, non-standard chart type, currency conversion, etc.

### Type

`simple string`

### Remarks

Because the value of this variable does not always use a simple "prefix:ticker" format, it is a poor candidate for use in boolean comparisons or string manipulation functions. In those contexts, run the variable's result through ticker.standard() to purify it. This will remove any extraneous information and return a ticker ID consistently formatted using the "prefix:ticker" structure.

To always access the script's main ticker ID, even within another context, use the syminfo.main_tickerid variable.

## ticker.new()
Timezone of the exchange of the chart main series. Possible values see in timestamp().

### Type

`simple string`

## timestamp()

## syminfo.type

The type of market the symbol belongs to. The values are "stock", "fund", "dr", "right", "bond", "warrant", "structured", "index", "forex", "futures", "spread", "economic", "fundamental", "crypto", "spot", "swap", "option", "commodity".

### Type

`simple string`

## syminfo.ticker

## syminfo.volumetype

Volume type of the current symbol. Possible values are: "base" for base currency, "quote" for quote currency, "tick" for the number of transactions, and "n/a" when there is no volume or its type is not specified.

### Type

`simple string`

### Remarks

Only some data feed suppliers provide information qualifying volume. As a result, the variable will return a value on some symbols only, mostly in the crypto sector.

## syminfo.type

## ta.accdist

Accumulation/distribution index.

### Type

`series float`

## ta.iii

Intraday Intensity Index.

### Type

`series float`

### Example

```pinescript

    if nz(close, 0.0) == 0.0 or nz(close[1], 0.0) == 0.0

        ta_nvi := prevNvi

##     else

        ta_nvi := (volume < nz(volume[1], 0.0)) ? prevNvi + ((close - close[1]) / close[1]) * prevNvi : prevNvi

    result = ta_nvi

## plot(f_nvi())

## ta.obv

On Balance Volume.

```

## plot(f_obv())

## ta.pvi

Positive Volume Index.

### Type

`series float`

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Positive Volume Index")
```

## plot(ta.pvi, color=color.yellow)

// the same on pine

## f_pvi() =>

    (close - open) / (high - low) * volume
```

## plot(f_wvad())

## table.all

Returns an array filled with all the current tables drawn by the script.

### Type

`array<table>`

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("table.all")
//delete all tables
table.new(position = position.top_right, columns = 2, rows = 1, bgcolor = color.yellow, border_width = 1)
a_allTables = table.all
if array.size(a_allTables) > 0
    for i = 0 to array.size(a_allTables) - 1
        table.delete(array.get(a_allTables, i))
```

### Remarks

The array is read-only. Index zero of the array is the ID of the oldest object on the chart.

## table.new()
Current bar time in UNIX format. It is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

### Type

`series int`

### Remarks

Note that this variable returns the timestamp based on the time of the bar's open. Because of that, for overnight sessions (e.g. EURUSD, where Monday session starts on Sunday, 17:00) this variable can return time before the specified date of the trading day. For example, on EURUSD, dayofmonth(time) can be lower by 1 than the date of the trading day, because the bar for the current day actually opens one day prior.

## time()
- **`The time of the current bar's close in UNIX format. It represents the number of milliseconds elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970. On tick charts and price-based charts such as Renko, line break, Kagi, point & figure, and range, this variable's series holds an na timestamp for the latest realtime bar`** (because the future closing time is unpredictable), but valid timestamps for all previous bars.

### Type

`series int`

## time
The timestamp that represents 00:00 UTC of the trading day the current bar belongs to, in UNIX format (the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970).

### Type

`series int`

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Friday session")
//@variable The day of week, based on the current `time_tradingday` value.
//          Uses "UTC+0" to return the daily session's timestamp at 00:00 UTC.
int tradingDayOfWeek = dayofweek(time_tradingday, "UTC+0")
//@variable Returns `true` if the `dayofweek` represents Friday, in exchange time.
//          It might never return `true` on overnight symbols, depending on the timeframe, since the Friday session
//          starts on Thursday.
bool isFriday = dayofweek == dayofweek.friday
//@variable Returns `true` if the `tradingDayOfWeek` is Friday.
//          Differs from `isFriday` on symbols with overnight sessions and for timeframes > "1D" on others.
bool isFridaySession = tradingDayOfWeek == dayofweek.friday
// Create a horizontal line at the `dayofweek.friday` value.
hline(dayofweek.friday, "Friday value", color.gray, hline.style_dashed, 2)
// Plot the `dayofweek` and `tradingDayOfWeek` for comparison.
plot(dayofweek, "Day of week", color.blue, 2)
plot(tradingDayOfWeek, "Trading day", color.teal, 3)
// Highlight the background when `isFriday` and `isFridaySession` occur.
bgcolor(isFriday ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : na, title = "isFriday highlight")
bgcolor(isFridaySession ? color.new(color.teal, 80) : na, title = "isFridaySession highlight")
```

### Remarks

This variable is helpful when working with overnight sessions, where the day's session can begin on the previous calendar day. For example, on the "FXCM:EURUSD" symbol, the Monday session starts on Sunday, 17:00, exchange time. Unlike time, which returns the timestamp for Sunday at 17:00 on the Monday daily bar, time_tradingday returns the timestamp for Monday at 00:00 UTC. When used on timeframes higher than "1D", time_tradingday returns the timestamp of the last trading day inside that bar (e.g., on "1W", it returns the timestamp of the final trading day within the week).

## time
Returns true if current resolution is a daily resolution, false otherwise.

### Type

`simple bool`

## timeframe.isdwm
Returns true if current resolution is a daily or weekly or monthly resolution, false otherwise.

### Type

`simple bool`

## timeframe.isintraday
- **`Returns true if current resolution is an intraday`** (minutes or seconds) resolution, false otherwise.

### Type

`simple bool`

### Type

`simple bool`

## timeframe.isdwm
Returns true if current resolution is a weekly resolution, false otherwise.

### Type

`simple bool`

## timeframe.isdwm
A string representation of the script's main timeframe. If the script is an indicator() that specifies a timeframe value in its declaration statement, this variable holds that value. Otherwise, its value represents the chart's timeframe. Unlike timeframe.period, this variable's value does not change when used in the expression argument of a request.*() function call.

The string's format is "<quantity>[<unit>]", where <unit> is "T" for ticks, "S" for seconds, "D" for days, "W" for weeks, and "M" for months, but is absent for minutes. No <unit> exists for hours: hourly timeframes are expressed in minutes.

The variable's value is: "10S" for 10 seconds, "30" for 30 minutes, "240" for four hours, "1D" for one day, "2W" for two weeks, and "3M" for one quarter.

### Type

`simple string`

## timeframe.period
Multiplier of resolution, e.g. '60' - 60, 'D' - 1, '5D' - 5, '12M' - 12.

### Type

`simple int`

## syminfo.ticker
- **`A string representation of the script's main timeframe or a requested timeframe, depending on how the script uses it. The variable's value represents the timeframe of a requested dataset when used in the expression argument of a request.*() function call. Otherwise, its value represents the script's main timeframe`** (timeframe.main_period), which equals either the timeframe argument of the indicator() declaration statement or the chart's timeframe.

The string's format is "<quantity>[<unit>]", where <unit> is "T" for ticks, "S" for seconds, "D" for days, "W" for weeks, and "M" for months, but is absent for minutes. No <unit> exists for hours: hourly timeframes are expressed in minutes.

The variable's value is: "10S" for 10 seconds, "30" for 30 minutes, "240" for four hours, "1D" for one day, "2W" for two weeks, and "3M" for one quarter.

### Type

`simple string`

### Remarks

To always access the script's main timeframe, even within another context, use the timeframe.main_period variable.

## timeframe.main_period
Current time in UNIX format. It is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

### Type

`series int`

### Remarks

Please note that using this variable/function can cause indicator repainting.

## timestamp()
Current bar volume.

### Type

`series float`

### Remarks

Previous values may be accessed with square brackets operator [], e.g. volume[1], volume[2].

## open
The week number of the year, in the exchange time zone, calculated from the bar's opening UNIX timestamp.

### Type

`series int`

### Remarks

This variable always references the week number corresponding to the bar's opening time. Consequently, for symbols with overnight sessions (e.g., "EURUSD", where the "Monday" session starts on Sunday at 17:00 in exchange time), the value may represent a previous calendar week rather than the week of the session's primary trading day.

## weekofyear()
Current bar year in exchange timezone.

### Type

`series int`

### Remarks

Note that this variable returns the year based on the time of the bar's open. For overnight sessions (e.g. EURUSD, where Monday session starts on Sunday, 17:00) this value can be lower by 1 than the year of the trading day.

`const string`

### Remarks

The default precision is 2, regardless of the precision of the chart itself. This can be changed with the 'precision' argument of the indicator() function.

## indicator()
Is a named constant for selecting the formatting of the script output values as prices in the indicator() function.

### Type

`const string`

### Remarks

If format is format.price, default precision value is set. You can use the precision argument of indicator function to change the precision value.

## indicator()
Is a named constant for selecting the formatting of the script output values as volume in the indicator() function, e.g. '5183' will be formatted as '5.183K'.

The decimal precision rules defined by this variable take precedence over other precision settings. When an indicator(), strategy(), or plot*() call uses this format option, the function's precision parameter will not affect the result.

A named constant for use with the oca_type parameter of the strategy.entry() and strategy.order() commands. It specifies that when another order with the same oca_name and oca_type executes, the strategy reduces the unfilled order by that order's size. If the unfilled order's size reaches 0 after reduction, it is the same as canceling the order entirely.

### Type

`const string`

### Remarks

Strategies cannot cancel or reduce pending orders from an OCA group if they execute on the same tick. For example, if the market price triggers two stop orders from strategy.order() calls with the same oca_* arguments, the strategy cannot fully or partially cancel either one.

Orders from strategy.exit() automatically use this OCA type, and they belong to the same OCA group by default.

## strategy.entry()

### Type

`const string`

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("strategy.percent_of_equity", overlay = false, default_qty_value = 100, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity, initial_capital = 1000000)
// As ‘qty’ is not defined, the previously defined values for the `default_qty_type` and `default_qty_value` parameters are used to enter trades, namely 100% of available equity.
if bar_index == 0
    strategy.entry("EN", strategy.long)
if bar_index == 2
    strategy.close("EN")
plot(strategy.equity)
 // The ‘qty’ parameter is set to 10. Entering position with fixed size of 10 contracts and entry market price = (10 * close).
if bar_index == 4
    strategy.entry("EN", strategy.long, qty = 10)
if bar_index == 6

## label.new()
Creates an alert trigger for an indicator or strategy, with a specified frequency, when called on the latest realtime bar. To activate alerts for a script containing calls to this function, open the "Create Alert" dialog box, then select the script name and "Any alert() function call" in the "Condition" section.

## Syntax
- **`message`** (series string) The message to send when the alert occurs.

- **`freq`** (input string) Optional. Determines the allowed frequency of the alert trigger. Possible values are: alert.freq_all (allows an alert on any realtime update), alert.freq_once_per_bar (allows an alert only on the first execution for each realtime bar), or alert.freq_once_per_bar_close (allows an alert only when a realtime bar closes). The default is alert.freq_once_per_bar.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`alert()` example", "", true)
ma = ta.sma(close, 14)
xUp = ta.crossover(close, ma)
if xUp
    // Trigger the alert the first time a cross occurs during the real-time bar.
    alert("Price (" + str.tostring(close) + ") crossed over MA (" + str.tostring(ma) + ").", alert.freq_once_per_bar)
plot(ma)
plotchar(xUp, "xUp", "▲", location.top, size = size.tiny)
```

### Remarks

The alert() function does not display information on the chart.

In contrast to alertcondition(), calls to this function do not count toward a script's plot count. Additionally, alert() calls are allowed in local scopes, including the scopes of exported library functions.

See this article in our Help Center to learn more about activating alerts from alert() calls.

## alertcondition()

## alertcondition()

Creates alert condition, that is available in Create Alert dialog. Please note, that alertcondition() does NOT create an alert, it just gives you more options in Create Alert dialog. Also, alertcondition() effect is invisible on chart.

## Syntax
- **`condition`** (series bool) Series of boolean values that is used for alert. True values mean alert fire, false - no alert. Required argument.

- **`title`** (const string) Title of the alert condition. Optional argument.

- **`message`** (const string) Message to display when alert fires. Optional argument.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("alertcondition", overlay=true)
alertcondition(close >= open, title='Alert on Green Bar', message='Green Bar!')
```

### Remarks

Please note that an alertcondition call generates an additional plot. All such calls are taken into account when we calculate the number of the output series per script.

## alert()

## array.abs()2 overloads

Returns an array containing the absolute value of each element in the original array.

Syntax & Overloads

## array.abs(id) → array<float>
- **`id`** (array<int/float>) An array object.

## array.new_float()
The function returns the mean of an array's elements.

Syntax & Overloads

## array.avg(id) → series float
- **`id`** (array<int/float>) An array object.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array.avg example")
a = array.new_float(0)
for i = 0 to 9
    array.push(a, close[i])
plot(array.avg(a))
```

### Returns

Mean of array's elements.

### Remarks

Returns na if the id array is empty.

## array.new_float()
The function returns the index of the value, or -1 if the value is not found. The array to search must be sorted in ascending order.

## Syntax
- **`id`** (array<int/float>) An array object.

- **`val`** (series int/float) The value to search for in the array.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array.binary_search")
a = array.from(5, -2, 0, 9, 1)
array.sort(a) // [-2, 0, 1, 5, 9]
position = array.binary_search(a, 0) // 1
plot(position)
```

### Remarks

A binary search works on arrays pre-sorted in ascending order. It begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the element matches the target value, its position in the array is returned. If the element's value is greater than the target value, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the element's value is less than the target value, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this recursively, the algorithm progressively eliminates smaller and smaller portions of the array in which the target value cannot lie.

## array.new_float()
The function returns the index of the value if it is found. When the value is not found, the function returns the index of the next smallest element to the left of where the value would lie if it was in the array. The array to search must be sorted in ascending order.

## Syntax
- **`id`** (array<int/float>) An array object.

- **`val`** (series int/float) The value to search for in the array.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array.binary_search_leftmost")
a = array.from(5, -2, 0, 9, 1)
array.sort(a) // [-2, 0, 1, 5, 9]
position = array.binary_search_leftmost(a, 3) // 2
plot(position)
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array.binary_search_leftmost, repetitive elements")
a = array.from(4, 5, 5, 5)
// Returns the index of the first instance.
position = array.binary_search_leftmost(a, 5)
plot(position) // Plots 1
```

### Remarks

A binary search works on arrays pre-sorted in ascending order. It begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the element matches the target value, its position in the array is returned. If the element's value is greater than the target value, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the element's value is less than the target value, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this recursively, the algorithm progressively eliminates smaller and smaller portions of the array in which the target value cannot lie.

## array.new_float()
The function returns the index of the value if it is found. When the value is not found, the function returns the index of the element to the right of where the value would lie if it was in the array. The array must be sorted in ascending order.

## Syntax
- **`id`** (array<int/float>) An array object.

- **`val`** (series int/float) The value to search for in the array.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array.binary_search_rightmost")
a = array.from(5, -2, 0, 9, 1)
array.sort(a) // [-2, 0, 1, 5, 9]
position = array.binary_search_rightmost(a, 3) // 3
plot(position)
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array.binary_search_rightmost, repetitive elements")
a = array.from(4, 5, 5, 5)
// Returns the index of the last instance.
position = array.binary_search_rightmost(a, 5)
plot(position) // Plots 3
```

### Remarks

A binary search works on sorted arrays in ascending order. It begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the element matches the target value, its position in the array is returned. If the element's value is greater than the target value, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the element's value is less than the target value, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this recursively, the algorithm progressively eliminates smaller and smaller portions of the array in which the target value cannot lie.

id (array<int/float>) An array object.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array.range example")
a = array.new_float(0)
for i = 0 to 9
    array.push(a, close[i])
plot(array.range(a))
```

### Returns

## array.new_float()
The function changes the contents of an array by removing the element with the specified index.

## Syntax
id (any array type) An array object.

- **`index`** (series int) The index of the element to remove.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array.remove example")
a = array.new_float(5,high)
removedEl = array.remove(a, 0)
plot(array.size(a))
plot(removedEl)
```

### Returns

The value of the removed element.

### Remarks

If the index is positive, the function counts forwards from the beginning of the array to the end. The index of the first element is 0, and the index of the last element is array.size() - 1. If the index is negative, the function counts backwards from the end of the array to the beginning. In this case, the index of the last element is -1, and the index of the first element is negative array.size(). For example, for an array that contains three elements, all of the following are valid arguments for the index parameter: 0, 1, 2, -1, -2, -3.

a = array.new_float(10)
for i = 0 to 9
    array.set(a, i, close[i])
plot(array.sum(a) / 10)
```

### Remarks

If the index is positive, the function counts forwards from the beginning of the array to the end. The index of the first element is 0, and the index of the last element is array.size() - 1. If the index is negative, the function counts backwards from the end of the array to the beginning. In this case, the index of the last element is -1, and the index of the first element is negative array.size(). For example, for an array that contains three elements, all of the following are valid arguments for the index parameter: 0, 1, 2, -1, -2, -3.

## hour
This declaration statement designates the script as an indicator and sets a number of indicator-related properties.

## Syntax

indicator(title, shorttitle, overlay, format, precision, scale, max_bars_back, timeframe, timeframe_gaps, explicit_plot_zorder, max_lines_count, max_labels_count, max_boxes_count, calc_bars_count, max_polylines_count, dynamic_requests, behind_chart) → void

## Arguments

- **`title`** (const string) The title of the script. It is displayed on the chart when no shorttitle argument is used, and becomes the publication's default title when publishing the script.

- **`shorttitle`** (const string) The script's display name on charts. If specified, it will replace the title argument in most chart-related windows. Optional. The default is the argument used for title.

- **`overlay`** (const bool) If true, the script's visuals appear on the main chart pane if the user adds it to the chart directly, or in another script's pane if the user applies it to that script. If false, the script's visuals appear in a separate pane. Changes to the overlay value apply only after the user adds the script to the chart again. Additionally, if the user moves the script to another pane by selecting a "Move to" option in the script's "More" menu, it does not move back to its original pane after any updates to the source code. The default is false. Strategy-specific labels that display entries and exits will be displayed over the main chart regardless of this setting.

- **`format`** (const string) Specifies the formatting of the script's displayed values. Possible values: format.inherit, format.price, format.volume, format.percent. Optional. The default is format.inherit.

- **`precision`** (const int) Specifies the number of digits after the floating point of the script's displayed values. Must be a non-negative integer no greater than 16. If format is set to format.inherit and precision is specified, the format will instead be set to format.price. When the function's format parameter uses format.volume, the precision parameter will not affect the result, as the decimal precision rules defined by format.volume supersede other precision settings. Optional. The default is inherited from the precision of the chart's symbol.

- **`scale`** (const scale_type) The price scale used. Possible values: scale.right, scale.left, scale.none. The scale.none value can only be applied in combination with overlay = true. Optional. By default, the script uses the same scale as the chart.

- **`max_bars_back`** (const int) The length of the historical buffer the script keeps for every variable and function, which determines how many past values can be referenced using the [] history-referencing operator. The required buffer size is automatically detected by the Pine Script® runtime. Using this parameter is only necessary when a runtime error occurs because automatic detection fails. More information on the underlying mechanics of the historical buffer can be found in our Help Center. Optional. The default is 0.

- **`timeframe`** (const string) Adds multi-timeframe functionality to simple scripts. When specified, a "Timeframe" field will be included in the "Calculation" section of the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. The field's default value will be the argument supplied, whose format must conform to timeframe string specifications. To specify the chart's timeframe, use an empty string or the timeframe.period variable. The parameter cannot be used with scripts using Pine Script® drawings. Optional. The default is timeframe.period.

- **`timeframe_gaps`** (const bool) Specifies how the indicator's values are displayed on chart bars when the timeframe is higher than the chart's. If true, a value only appears on a chart bar when the higher timeframe value becomes available, otherwise na is returned (thus a "gap" occurs). With false, what would otherwise be gaps are filled with the latest known value returned, avoiding na values. When specified, a "Wait for timeframe closes" checkbox will be included in the "Calculation" section of the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. Optional. The default is true.

- **`explicit_plot_zorder`** (const bool) Specifies the order in which the script's plots, fills, and hlines are rendered. If true, plots are drawn in the order in which they appear in the script's code, each newer plot being drawn above the previous ones. This only applies to plot*() functions, fill(), and hline(). Optional. The default is false.

- **`max_lines_count`** (const int) The number of last line drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. The count is approximate; more drawings than the specified count may be displayed. Optional. The default is 50.

- **`max_labels_count`** (const int) The number of last label drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. The count is approximate; more drawings than the specified count may be displayed. Optional. The default is 50.

- **`max_boxes_count`** (const int) The number of last box drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. The count is approximate; more drawings than the specified count may be displayed. Optional. The default is 50.

- **`calc_bars_count`** (const int) Limits the initial calculation of a script to the last number of bars specified. When specified, a "Calculated bars" field will be included in the "Calculation" section of the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. Optional. The default is 0, in which case the script executes on all available bars.

- **`max_polylines_count`** (const int) The number of last polyline drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-100. The count is approximate; more drawings than the specified count may be displayed. Optional. The default is 50.

- **`dynamic_requests`** (const bool) Specifies whether the script can dynamically call functions from the request.*() namespace. Dynamic request.*() calls are allowed within the local scopes of conditional structures (e.g., if), loops (e.g., for), and exported functions. Additionally, such calls allow "series" arguments for many of their parameters. Optional. The default is true. See the User Manual's Dynamic requests section for more information.

- **`behind_chart`** (const bool) Optional. Controls whether all plots and drawings appear behind the chart display (if true) or in front of it (if false). This parameter only takes effect when the overlay parameter is true. The default is true.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("My script", shorttitle="Script")
plot(close)
```

### Remarks

Every indicator script must have one indicator() call.

### Remarks

Any curly braces within an unquoted pattern must be balanced. For example, "ab {0} de" and "ab '}' de" are valid patterns, but "ab {0'}' de", "ab } de" and "''{''" are not.

The function can apply additional formatting to some values inside of the {}. The list of additional formatting options can be found in the EXAMPLE section of the str.format() article.

- **`The string used as the formatString argument can contain single quote characters`** ('). However, one must pair all single quotes in that string to avoid unexpected formatting results.

The "Pine logs..." button is accessible from the "More" dropdown in the Pine Editor and from the "More" dropdown in the status line of any script that uses log.*() functions.

## log.warning()2 overloads

Converts the formatting string and value(s) into a formatted string, and sends the result to the "Pine logs" menu tagged with the "warning" debug level.

- **`The formatting string can contain literal text and one placeholder in curly braces {} for each value to be formatted. Each placeholder consists of the index of the required argument`** (beginning at 0) that will replace it, and an optional format specifier. The index represents the position of that argument in the function's argument list.

Syntax & Overloads

plot(prevFirst)
plot(currFirst)
```

### Returns

The previous value associated with key if the key was already present in the map, or na if the key is new.

### Remarks

Maps maintain insertion order. Note that the order does not change when inserting a pair with a key that's already in the map. The new pair replaces the existing pair with the key in such cases.

## map.new<type,type>()

// Create a 2x3 "int" matrix containing values `0`.
m = matrix.new<int>(2, 3, 0)
// Add a column with `na` values to the matrix.
matrix.add_col(m)
// Display matrix elements.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    var t = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 2, color.green)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, "Matrix elements:")
    table.cell(t, 0, 1, str.tostring(m))

```

## if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory

    // Create an empty matrix object.

##     var m = matrix.new<int>()

    // Create an array with values `1` and `3`.

//@version=6
indicator("`matrix.add_row()` Example 1")
// Create a 2x3 "int" matrix containing values `0`.
m = matrix.new<int>(2, 3, 0)
// Add a row with `na` values to the matrix.
matrix.add_row(m)
// Display matrix elements.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    var t = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 2, color.green)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, "Matrix elements:")
    table.cell(t, 0, 1, str.tostring(m))
Adding an array as a row to the matrix
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`matrix.add_row()` Example 2")
```

## if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory

    // Create an empty matrix object.

##     var m = matrix.new<int>()

    // Create an array with values `1` and `2`.

##     var a = array.from(1, 2)

    // Add the `a` array as the first row of the empty matrix.

##     matrix.add_row(m, 0, a)

    // Display matrix elements.

    var t = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 2, color.green)

##     table.cell(t, 0, 0, "Matrix elements:")

##     table.cell(t, 0, 1, str.tostring(m))

```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`matrix.new<type>()` Example 4")
// Function to create a matrix with random values (0.0 to 1.0).
matrixRandom(int rows, int columns)=>
    result = matrix.new<float>(rows, columns)
    for i = 0 to rows - 1
        for j = 0 to columns - 1
            matrix.set(result, i, j, math.random())
    result
// Create a 2x3 matrix with random values.
var m = matrixRandom(2, 3)
// Display using a label.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    label.new(bar_index, high, str.tostring(m))
```

### Returns

The ID of the new matrix object.

## matrix.set()
The function returns the pseudoinverse of a matrix.

Syntax & Overloads

## matrix.pinv(id) → matrix<float>
- **`id`** (matrix<int/float>) A matrix object.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`matrix.pinv()` Example")
// For efficiency, execute this code only once.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    // Create a 2x2 matrix.
    var m1 = matrix.new<int>(2, 2, na)
    // Fill the matrix with values.

    matrix.set(m1, 0, 1, 2)
    matrix.set(m1, 1, 0, 3)
    matrix.set(m1, 1, 1, 4)
    // Pseudoinverse of the matrix.
    var m2 = matrix.pinv(m1)
    // Display matrix elements.
    var t = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 2, color.green)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, "Original Matrix:")

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("matrix_remove_col", overlay = true)
// Create a 2x2 matrix with ones.
var matrixOrig = matrix.new<int>(2, 2, 1)
// Set values to the 'matrixOrig' matrix.
matrix.set(matrixOrig, 0, 1, 2)
matrix.set(matrixOrig, 1, 0, 3)

```

### Returns

An array containing the elements of the column removed from the id matrix.

    table.cell(t, 2, 1, str.tostring(matrixCopy))
```

    var m2 = matrix.copy(m1)
    // Reshape the copy to a 3x2.
    matrix.reshape(m2, 3, 2)
    // Display using a table.
    var t = table.new(position.top_right, 2, 2, color.green)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, "Original matrix:")

```

### Returns

A new matrix containing the transposed version of the id matrix.

## matrix.new<type>()
Function sets the maximum number of bars that is available for historical reference of a given built-in or user variable. When operator '[]' is applied to a variable - it is a reference to a historical value of that variable.

- **`If an argument of an operator '[]' is a compile time constant value`** (e.g. 'v[10]', 'close[500]') then there is no need to use 'max_bars_back' function for that variable. Pine Script® compiler will use that constant value as history buffer size.

- **`If an argument of an operator '[]' is a value, calculated at runtime`** (e.g. 'v[i]' where 'i' - is a series variable) then Pine Script® attempts to autodetect the history buffer size at runtime. Sometimes it fails and the script crashes at runtime because it eventually refers to historical values that are out of the buffer. In that case you should use 'max_bars_back' to fix that problem manually.

## Syntax
- **`var`** (series int/float/bool/color/label/line) Series variable identifier for which history buffer should be resized. Possible values are: 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'time', or any user defined variable id.

- **`num`** (const int) History buffer size which is the number of bars that could be referenced for variable 'var'.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("max_bars_back")
close_() => close
depth() => 400
d = depth()
v = close_()
max_bars_back(v, 500)
out = if bar_index > 0
    v[d]
else
    v
plot(out)
```

### Returns

## void

### Remarks

At the moment 'max_bars_back' cannot be applied to built-ins like 'hl2', 'hlc3', 'ohlc4'. Please use multiple 'max_bars_back' calls as workaround here (e.g. instead of a single ‘max_bars_back(hl2, 100)’ call you should call the function twice: ‘max_bars_back(high, 100), max_bars_back(low, 100)’).

If the indicator() or strategy() 'max_bars_back' parameter is used, all variables in the indicator are affected. This may result in excessive memory usage and cause runtime problems. When possible (i.e. when the cause is a variable rather than a function), please use the max_bars_back() function instead.

## indicator()
- **`time`** (series int) UNIX time in milliseconds.

- **`timezone`** (series string) Allows adjusting the returned value to a time zone specified in either UTC/GMT notation (e.g., "UTC-5", "GMT+0530") or as an IANA time zone database name (e.g., "America/New_York"). Optional. The default is syminfo.timezone.

### Returns

Minute (in exchange timezone) for provided UNIX time.

### Remarks

UNIX time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

## minute
- **`time`** (series int) UNIX time in milliseconds.

- **`timezone`** (series string) Allows adjusting the returned value to a time zone specified in either UTC/GMT notation (e.g., "UTC-5", "GMT+0530") or as an IANA time zone database name (e.g., "America/New_York"). Optional. The default is syminfo.timezone.

### Returns

Month (in exchange timezone) for provided UNIX time.

### Remarks

UNIX time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

Note that this function returns the month based on the time of the bar's open. For overnight sessions (e.g. EURUSD, where Monday session starts on Sunday, 17:00 UTC-4) this value can be lower by 1 than the month of the trading day.

## month
Tests if x is na.

Syntax & Overloads

## na(x) → simple bool
- **`x`** (simple int/float) Value to be tested.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("na")
// Use the `na()` function to test for `na`.
plot(na(close[1]) ? close : close[1])
// ALTERNATIVE
// `nz()` also tests `close[1]` for `na`. It returns `close[1]` if it is not `na`, and `close` if it is.
plot(nz(close[1], close))
```

### Returns

Returns true if x is na, false otherwise.

## na
Replaces na (undefined) values with either a type-specific default value or a specified replacement.

The ID of a new polyline object that a script can use in other polyline.*() functions.

## chart.point.new()

## request.currency_rate()

Provides a daily rate that can be used to convert a value expressed in the from currency to another in the to currency.

## Syntax

request.currency_rate(from, to, ignore_invalid_currency) → series float

## Arguments

- **`from`** (series string) The currency in which the value to be converted is expressed. Possible values: a three-letter string with the currency code in the ISO 4217 format (e.g. "USD"), or one of the built-in variables that return currency codes, like syminfo.currency or currency.USD.

- **`to`** (series string) The currency in which the value is to be converted. Possible values: a three-letter string with the currency code in the ISO 4217 format (e.g. "USD"), or one of the built-in variables that return currency codes, like syminfo.currency or currency.USD.

- **`ignore_invalid_currency`** (series bool) Determines the behavior of the function if a conversion rate between the two currencies cannot be calculated: if false, the script will halt and return a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. Optional. The default is false.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Close in British Pounds")
rate = request.currency_rate(syminfo.currency, "GBP")
plot(close * rate)
```

### Remarks

If from and to arguments are equal, function returns 1. Please note that using this variable/function can cause indicator repainting.

- **`ignore_invalid_symbol`** (input bool) An optional parameter. Determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if false, the script will halt and return a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. The default value is false.

- **`currency`** (series string) Currency into which the symbol's currency-related dividends values (e.g. dividends.gross) are to be converted. The conversion rate depends on the previous daily value of a corresponding currency pair from the most popular exchange. A spread symbol is used if no exchange provides the rate directly. Possible values: a "string" representing a valid currency code (e.g., "USD" or "USDT") or a constant from the currency.* namespace (e.g., currency.USD or currency.USDT). The default is syminfo.currency.

plot(s2)
```

### Returns

Requested series, or n/a if there is no earnings data for the specified symbol.

## request.dividends()
Requests economic data for a symbol. Economic data includes information such as the state of a country's economy (GDP, inflation rate, etc.) or of a particular industry (steel production, ICU beds, etc.).

## Syntax

request.economic(country_code, field, gaps, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float

## Arguments

- **`country_code`** (series string) The code of the country (e.g. "US") or the region (e.g. "EU") for which the economic data is requested.

- **`field`** (series string) The code of the requested economic metric (e.g., "GDP"). The Help Center article lists the metrics and their codes.

- **`gaps`** (simple barmerge_gaps) Specifies how the returned values are merged on chart bars. Possible values: barmerge.gaps_off, barmerge.gaps_on. With barmerge.gaps_on, a value only appears on the current chart bar when it first becomes available from the function's context, otherwise na is returned (thus a "gap" occurs). With barmerge.gaps_off, what would otherwise be gaps are filled with the latest known value returned, avoiding na values. Optional. The default is barmerge.gaps_off.

- **`ignore_invalid_symbol`** (input bool) Determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if false, the script will halt and return a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. Optional. The default is false.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("US GDP")
e = request.economic("US", "GDP")
plot(e)
```

### Returns

Requested series.

### Remarks

Economic data can also be accessed from charts, just like a regular symbol. Use "ECONOMIC" as the exchange name and {country_code}{field} as the ticker. The name of US GDP data is thus "ECONOMIC:USGDP".

## request.financial()

## request.financial()

Requests financial series for symbol.

## Syntax

request.financial(symbol, financial_id, period, gaps, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency) → series float

## Arguments

Default value is barmerge.gaps_off.

- **`ignore_invalid_symbol`** (input bool) An optional parameter. Determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if false, the script will halt and return a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. The default value is false.

- **`currency`** (series string) Optional. Currency into which the symbol's financial metrics (e.g. Net Income) are to be converted. The conversion rate depends on the previous daily value of a corresponding currency pair from the most popular exchange. A spread symbol is used if no exchange provides the rate directly.

## request.security()
Note: This function has been deprecated due to the API change from NASDAQ Data Link. Requests for "QUANDL" symbols are no longer valid and requests for them return a runtime error.

Some of the data previously provided by this function is available on TradingView through other feeds, such as "BCHAIN" or "FRED". Use Symbol Search to look for such data based on its description. Commitment of Traders (COT) data can be requested using the official LibraryCOT library.

Requests Nasdaq Data Link (formerly Quandl) data for a symbol.

## Syntax

request.quandl(ticker, gaps, index, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float

## Arguments

- **`ticker`** (series string) Symbol. Note that the name of a time series and Quandl data feed should be divided by a forward slash. For example: "CFTC/SB_FO_ALL".

- **`gaps`** (simple barmerge_gaps) Merge strategy for the requested data (requested data automatically merges with the main series: OHLC data). Possible values include: barmerge.gaps_on, barmerge.gaps_off. barmerge.gaps_on - requested data is merged with possible gaps (na values). barmerge.gaps_off - requested data is merged continuously without gaps, all the gaps are filled with the previous, nearest existing values. Default value is barmerge.gaps_off.

- **`index`** (series int) A Quandl time-series column index.

- **`ignore_invalid_symbol`** (input bool) An optional parameter. Determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if false, the script will halt and return a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. The default value is false.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("request.quandl")
f = request.quandl("CFTC/SB_FO_ALL", barmerge.gaps_off, 0)
plot(f)
```

### Returns

Requested series.

## request.security()
Requests the result of an expression from a specified context (symbol and timeframe).

## Syntax

request.security(symbol, timeframe, expression, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, calc_bars_count) → series <type>

## Arguments

- **`symbol`** (series string) Symbol or ticker identifier of the requested data. Use an empty string or syminfo.tickerid to request data using the chart's symbol. To retrieve data with additional modifiers (extended sessions, dividend adjustments, non-standard chart types like Heikin Ashi and Renko, etc.), create a custom ticker ID for the request using the functions in the ticker.* namespace.

- **`timeframe`** (series string) Timeframe of the requested data. Use an empty string or timeframe.period to request data from the chart's timeframe or the timeframe specified in the indicator() function. To request data from a different timeframe, supply a valid timeframe string. See here to learn about specifying timeframe strings.

- **`expression`** (variable, function, object, array, matrix, or map of series int/float/bool/string/color/enum, or a tuple of these) The expression to calculate and return from the requested context. It can accept a built-in variable like close, a user-defined variable, an expression such as ta.change(close) / (high - low), a function call that does not use Pine Script® drawings, an object, a collection, or a tuple of expressions.

- **`gaps`** (simple barmerge_gaps) Specifies how the returned values are merged on chart bars. Possible values: barmerge.gaps_on, barmerge.gaps_off. With barmerge.gaps_on a value only appears on the current chart bar when it first becomes available from the function's context, otherwise na is returned (thus a "gap" occurs). With barmerge.gaps_off what would otherwise be gaps are filled with the latest known value returned, avoiding na values. Optional. The default is barmerge.gaps_off.

- **`lookahead`** (simple barmerge_lookahead) On historical bars only, returns data from the timeframe before it elapses. Possible values: barmerge.lookahead_on, barmerge.lookahead_off. Has no effect on realtime values. Optional. The default is barmerge.lookahead_off starting from Pine Script® v3. The default is barmerge.lookahead_on in v1 and v2. WARNING: Using barmerge.lookahead_on at timeframes higher than the chart's without offsetting the expression argument like in close[1] will introduce future leak in scripts, as the function will then return the close price before it is actually known in the current context. As is explained in the User Manual's page on Repainting this will produce misleading results.

- **`ignore_invalid_symbol`** (input bool) Determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if false, the script will halt and throw a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. Optional. The default is false.

- **`currency`** (series string) Optional. Specifies the target currency for converting values expressed in currency units (e.g., open, high, low, close) or expressions involving such values. Literal values such as 200 are not converted. The conversion rate for monetary values depends on the previous daily value of a corresponding currency pair from the most popular exchange. A spread symbol is used if no exchange provides the rate directly. Possible values: a "string" representing a valid currency code (e.g., "USD" or "USDT") or a constant from the currency.* namespace (e.g., currency.USD or currency.USDT). The default is syminfo.currency.

- **`calc_bars_count`** (simple int) Optional. Determines the maximum number of recent historical bars that the function can request. If specified, the function evaluates the expression argument starting from that number of bars behind the last historical bar in the requested dataset, treating those bars as the only available data. Limiting the number of historical bars in a request can help improve calculation efficiency in some cases. The default is 100,000 bars, which is the maximum number of bars that non-professional plans can request. See the Intrabars section of the User Manual's Limitations page to learn more about requested bar limits.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Simple `request.security()` calls")
// Returns 1D close of the current symbol.
dailyClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close)
plot(dailyClose)
// Returns the close of "AAPL" from the same timeframe as currently open on the chart.
aaplClose = request.security("AAPL", timeframe.period, close)
plot(aaplClose)
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Advanced `request.security()` calls")
// This calculates a 10-period moving average on the active chart.
sma = ta.sma(close, 10)
// This sends the `sma` calculation for execution in the context of the "AAPL" symbol at a "240" (4 hours) timeframe.
aaplSma = request.security("AAPL", "240", sma)
plot(aaplSma)
// To avoid differences on historical and realtime bars, you can use this technique, which only returns a value from the higher timeframe on the bar after it completes:
indexHighTF = barstate.isrealtime ? 1 : 0
indexCurrTF = barstate.isrealtime ? 0 : 1
nonRepaintingClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close[indexHighTF])[indexCurrTF]
plot(nonRepaintingClose, "Non-repainting close")
// Returns the 1H close of "AAPL", extended session included. The value is dividend-adjusted.
extendedTicker = ticker.modify("NASDAQ:AAPL", session = session.extended, adjustment = adjustment.dividends)
aaplExtAdj = request.security(extendedTicker, "60", close)
plot(aaplExtAdj)
// Returns the result of a user-defined function.
// The `max` variable is mutable, but we can pass it to `request.security()` because it is wrapped in a function.
allTimeHigh(source) =>
    var max = source
    max := math.max(max, source)
allTimeHigh1D = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", allTimeHigh(high))
// By using a tuple `expression`, we obtain several values with only one `request.security()` call.
[open1D, high1D, low1D, close1D, ema1D] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", [open, high, low, close, ta.ema(close, 10)])
plotcandle(open1D, high1D, low1D, close1D)
plot(ema1D)
// Returns an array containing the OHLC values of the chart's symbol from the 1D timeframe.
ohlcArray = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", array.from(open, high, low, close))
plotcandle(array.get(ohlcArray, 0), array.get(ohlcArray, 1), array.get(ohlcArray, 2), array.get(ohlcArray, 3))
```

### Returns

A result determined by expression.

### Remarks

Scripts using this function might calculate differently on historical and realtime bars, leading to repainting.

A single script can contain no more than 40 unique request.*() function calls. A call is unique only if it does not call the same function with the same arguments.

When using two calls to a request.*() function to evaluate the same expression from the same context with different calc_bars_count values, the second call requests the same number of historical bars as the first. For example, if a script calls request.security("AAPL", "", close, calc_bars_count = 3) after it calls request.security("AAPL", "", close, calc_bars_count = 5), the second call also uses five bars of historical data, not three.

The symbol of a request.() call can be inherited if it is not specified precisely, i.e., if the symbol argument is an empty string or syminfo.tickerid. Similarly, the timeframe of a request.() call can be inherited if the timeframe argument is an empty string or timeframe.period. These values are normally taken from the chart on which the script is running. However, if request.*() function A is called from within the expression of request.*() function B, then function A can inherit the values from function B. See here for more information.

## syminfo.ticker
Requests the results of an expression from a specified symbol on a timeframe lower than or equal to the chart's timeframe. It returns an array containing one element for each lower-timeframe bar within the chart bar. On a 5-minute chart, requesting data using a timeframe argument of "1" typically returns an array with five elements representing the value of the expression on each 1-minute bar, ordered by time with the earliest value first.

## Syntax

request.security_lower_tf(symbol, timeframe, expression, ignore_invalid_symbol, currency, ignore_invalid_timeframe, calc_bars_count) → array<type>

## Arguments

- **`symbol`** (series string) Symbol or ticker identifier of the requested data. Use an empty string or syminfo.tickerid to request data using the chart's symbol. To retrieve data with additional modifiers (extended sessions, dividend adjustments, non-standard chart types like Heikin Ashi and Renko, etc.), create a custom ticker ID for the request using the functions in the ticker.* namespace.

- **`timeframe`** (series string) Timeframe of the requested data. Use an empty string or timeframe.period to request data from the chart's timeframe or the timeframe specified in the indicator() function. To request data from a different timeframe, supply a valid timeframe string. See here to learn about specifying timeframe strings.

- **`expression`** (variable, object or function of series int/float/bool/string/color/enum, or a tuple of these) The expression to calculate and return from the requested context. It can accept a built-in variable like close, a user-defined variable, an expression such as ta.change(close) / (high - low), a function call that does not use Pine Script® drawings, an object, or a tuple of expressions. Collections are not allowed unless they are within the fields of an object

- **`ignore_invalid_symbol`** (series bool) Determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if false, the script will halt and throw a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. Optional. The default is false.

- **`currency`** (series string) Optional. Specifies the target currency for converting values expressed in currency units (e.g., open, high, low, close) or expressions involving such values. Literal values such as 200 are not converted. The conversion rate for monetary values depends on the previous daily value of a corresponding currency pair from the most popular exchange. A spread symbol is used if no exchange provides the rate directly. Possible values: a "string" representing a valid currency code (e.g., "USD" or "USDT") or a constant from the currency.* namespace (e.g., currency.USD or currency.USDT). The default is syminfo.currency.

- **`ignore_invalid_timeframe`** (series bool) Determines the behavior of the function when the chart's timeframe is smaller than the timeframe used in the function call. If false, the script will halt and throw a runtime error. If true, the function will return na and execution will continue. Optional. The default is false.

- **`calc_bars_count`** (simple int) Optional. Determines the maximum number of recent historical bars that the function can request. If specified, the function evaluates the expression argument starting from that number of bars behind the last historical bar in the requested dataset, treating those bars as the only available data. Limiting the number of historical bars in a request can help improve calculation efficiency in some cases. The default is 100,000 bars, which is the maximum number of bars that non-professional plans can request. See the Intrabars section of the User Manual's Limitations page to learn more about requested bar limits.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`request.security_lower_tf()` Example", overlay = true)
// If the current chart timeframe is set to 120 minutes, then the `arrayClose` array will contain two 'close' values from the 60 minute timeframe for each bar.
arrClose = request.security_lower_tf(syminfo.tickerid, "60", close)
if bar_index == last_bar_index - 1
    label.new(bar_index, high, str.tostring(arrClose))
```

### Returns

An array of a type determined by expression, or a tuple of these.

### Remarks

Scripts using this function might calculate differently on historical and realtime bars, leading to repainting.

Please note that spreads (e.g., "AAPL+MSFT*TSLA") do not always return reliable data with this function.

A single script can contain no more than 40 unique request.*() function calls. A call is unique only if it does not call the same function with the same arguments.

When using two calls to a request.*() function to evaluate the same expression from the same context with different calc_bars_count values, the second call requests the same number of historical bars as the first. For example, if a script calls request.security("AAPL", "", close, calc_bars_count = 3) after it calls request.security("AAPL", "", close, calc_bars_count = 5), the second call also uses five bars of historical data, not three.

The symbol of a request.() call can be inherited if it is not specified precisely, i.e., if the symbol argument is an empty string or syminfo.tickerid. Similarly, the timeframe of a request.() call can be inherited if the timeframe argument is an empty string or timeframe.period. These values are normally taken from the chart that the script is running on. However, if request.*() function A is called from within the expression of request.*() function B, then function A can inherit the values from function B. See here for more information.

## request.security()
Requests the result of an expression evaluated on data from a user-maintained GitHub repository. **Note:**The creation of new Pine Seeds repositories is suspended; only existing repositories are currently supported. See the Pine Seeds documentation on GitHub to learn more.

## Syntax

request.seed(source, symbol, expression, ignore_invalid_symbol, calc_bars_count) → series <type>

## Arguments

- **`source`** (series string) Name of the GitHub repository.

- **`symbol`** (series string) Name of the file in the GitHub repository containing the data. The ".csv" file extension must not be included.

expression (<arg_expr_type>) An expression to be calculated and returned from the requested symbol's context. It can be a built-in variable like close, an expression such as ta.sma(close, 100), a non-mutable variable previously calculated in the script, a function call that does not use Pine Script® drawings, an array, a matrix, or a tuple. Mutable variables are not allowed, unless they are enclosed in the body of a function used in the expression.

- **`ignore_invalid_symbol`** (input bool) Determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if false, the script will halt and throw a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. Optional. The default is false.

- **`calc_bars_count`** (simple int) Optional. If specified, the function requests only this number of values from the end of the symbol's history and calculates expression as if these values are the only available data, which might improve calculation speed in some cases. The default is 100,000. For information about the bar limits for different TradingView plans, see the Chart bars section of the Limitations page in the User Manual.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("BTC Development Activity")
[devAct, devActSMA] = request.seed("seed_crypto_santiment", "BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY", [close, ta.sma(close, 10)])
```

## request.splits()

Requests splits data for the specified symbol.

## Syntax

request.splits(ticker, field, gaps, lookahead, ignore_invalid_symbol) → series float

## Arguments

- **`ticker`** (series string) Symbol. Note that the symbol should be passed with a prefix. For example: "NASDAQ:AAPL" instead of "AAPL". Using syminfo.ticker will cause an error. Use syminfo.tickerid instead.

- **`field`** (series string) Input string. Possible values include: splits.denominator, splits.numerator.

- **`gaps`** (simple barmerge_gaps) Merge strategy for the requested data (requested data automatically merges with the main series OHLC data). Possible values: barmerge.gaps_on, barmerge.gaps_off. barmerge.gaps_on - requested data is merged with possible gaps (na values). barmerge.gaps_off - requested data is merged continuously without gaps, all the gaps are filled with the previous nearest existing values. Default value is barmerge.gaps_off.

- **`lookahead`** (simple barmerge_lookahead) Merge strategy for the requested data position. Possible values: barmerge.lookahead_on, barmerge.lookahead_off. Default value is barmerge.lookahead_off starting from version 3. Note that behavour is the same on real-time, and differs only on history.

- **`ignore_invalid_symbol`** (input bool) An optional parameter. Determines the behavior of the function if the specified symbol is not found: if false, the script will halt and return a runtime error; if true, the function will return na and execution will continue. The default value is false.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("request.splits")
s1 = request.splits("NASDAQ:BELFA", splits.denominator)
plot(s1)
s2 = request.splits("NASDAQ:BELFA", splits.denominator, gaps=barmerge.gaps_on, lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_on)
plot(s2)
```

### Returns

Requested series, or n/a if there is no splits data for the specified symbol.

## str.startswith()

## str.format()2 overloads

- **`Creates a formatted string using a specified formatting string`** (formatString) and one or more additional arguments (arg0, arg1, etc.). The formatting string defines the structure of the returned string, where all placeholders in curly brackets ({}) refer to the additional arguments. Each placeholder requires a number representing an argument's position, starting from 0. For instance, the placeholder {0} refers to the first argument after formatString (arg0), {1} refers to the second (arg1), and so on. The function replaces each placeholder with a string representation of the corresponding argument.

Syntax & Overloads

str.format(formatString, arg0, arg1, ...) → simple string

str.format(formatString, arg0, arg1, ...) → series string

## Arguments

- **`formatString`** (simple string) Format string.

- **`arg0, arg1, ...`** (simple int/float/bool/string) Values to format.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Simple `str.format()` demo")
//@variable A formatted string that includes representations of the current `bar_index` and `close` values.
//          The placeholder `{0}` refers to the first argument after the formatting string (`bar_index`), and
//          `{1}` refers to the second (`close`).
string labelText = str.format("Current bar index: {0}\nCurrent bar close: {1}", bar_index, close)
// Draw a label to display the `labelText` string at the current bar's `high` price.
label.new(bar_index, high, labelText)
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Extensive `str.format()` demo", overlay=true)
// The format specifier inside the curly braces accepts certain modifiers:
// - Specify the number of decimals to display:
s1 = str.format("{0,number,#.#}", 1.34) // returns: 1.3
label.new(bar_index, close, text=s1)
// - Round a float value to an integer:
s2 = str.format("{0,number,integer}", 1.34) // returns: 1
label.new(bar_index - 1, close, text=s2)
// - Display a number in currency:
s3 = str.format("{0,number,currency}", 1.34) // returns: $1.34
label.new(bar_index - 2, close, text=s3)
// - Display a number as a percentage:
s4 = str.format("{0,number,percent}", 0.5) // returns: 50%
label.new(bar_index - 3, close, text=s4)
// EXAMPLES WITH SEVERAL ARGUMENTS
// returns: Number 1 is not equal to 4
s5 = str.format("Number {0} is not {1} to {2}", 1, "equal", 4)
label.new(bar_index - 4, close, text=s5)
// returns: 1.34 != 1.3
s6 = str.format("{0} != {0, number, #.#}", 1.34)
label.new(bar_index - 5, close, text=s6)
// returns: 1 is equal to 1, but 2 is equal to 2
s7 = str.format("{0, number, integer} is equal to 1, but {1, number, integer} is equal to 2", 1.34, 1.52)
label.new(bar_index - 6, close, text=s7)
// returns: The cash turnover amounted to $1,340,000.00
s8 = str.format("The cash turnover amounted to {0, number, currency}", 1340000)
label.new(bar_index - 7, close, text=s8)
// returns: Expected return is 10% - 20%
s9 = str.format("Expected return is {0, number, percent} - {1, number, percent}", 0.1, 0.2)
label.new(bar_index - 8, close, text=s9)
```

### Returns

The formatted string.

### Remarks

- **`The string used as the formatString argument can contain single quote characters`** ('). However, programmers must pair all single quotes in that string to avoid unexpected formatting results.

All non-quoted left curly brackets must have corresponding right curly brackets in the formatting string. If the string contains imbalanced left curly brackets, it causes a runtime error. For example, "ab {0} de" and "ab }{0} de" are valid formatting strings, but "ab {0'}' de", "ab }{0}{ de" and "''{''{0}" are not.

The placeholders for "int" or "float" values or arrays can include modifiers and formatting tokens to customize how the resulting string represents them.

For example, the placeholder {0,number,#.#) specifies that the result inserts characters representing the arg0 number rounded to one fractional digit.

For detailed information about placeholders and supported formats, refer to the Formatting strings section of our User Manual's Strings page.

- **`The apostrophe`** (') acts as a quote character rather than a literal character inside formatting strings. If a formatting string has a sequence of characters between two apostrophes, the function's result includes those characters literally. For instance, the substring '{' adds a literal { character to the result instead of treating it as the start of a placeholder. Note that if a formatting string uses apostrophes instead of quotation marks for its enclosing characters, the string must escape any apostrophes within the character sequence using the backslash.

## str.format_time()

Converts the time timestamp into a string formatted according to format and timezone.

## Syntax

str.format_time(time, format, timezone) → series string

## Arguments

- **`time`** (series int) UNIX time, in milliseconds.

- **`format`** (series string) A format string specifying the date/time representation of the time in the returned string. All letters used in the string, except those escaped by single quotation marks ', are considered formatting tokens and will be used as a formatting instruction. Refer to the Remarks section for a list of the most useful tokens. Optional. The default is "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ", which represents the ISO 8601 standard.

- **`timezone`** (series string) Allows adjusting the returned value to a time zone specified in either UTC/GMT notation (e.g., "UTC-5", "GMT+0530") or as an IANA time zone database name (e.g., "America/New_York"). Optional. The default is syminfo.timezone.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("str.format_time")
if timeframe.change("1D")
    formattedTime = str.format_time(time, "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm", syminfo.timezone)
    label.new(bar_index, high, formattedTime)
```

### Returns

The formatted string.

### Remarks

The M, d, h, H, m and s tokens can all be doubled to generate leading zeros. For example, the month of January will display as 1 with M, or 01 with MM.

The most frequently used formatting tokens are:

y - Year. Use yy to output the last two digits of the year or yyyy to output all four. Year 2000 will be 00 with yy or 2000 with yyyy.

M - Month. Not to be confused with lowercase m, which stands for minute.

d - Day of the month.

a - AM/PM postfix.

h - Hour in the 12-hour format. The last hour of the day will be 11 in this format.

H - Hour in the 24-hour format. The last hour of the day will be 23 in this format.

m - Minute.

s - Second.

S - Fractions of a second.

Z - Timezone, the HHmm offset from UTC, preceded by either + or -.

## strategy()

This declaration statement designates the script as a strategy and sets a number of strategy-related properties.

## Syntax

strategy(title, shorttitle, overlay, format, precision, scale, pyramiding, calc_on_order_fills, calc_on_every_tick, max_bars_back, backtest_fill_limits_assumption, default_qty_type, default_qty_value, initial_capital, currency, slippage, commission_type, commission_value, process_orders_on_close, close_entries_rule, margin_long, margin_short, explicit_plot_zorder, max_lines_count, max_labels_count, max_boxes_count, calc_bars_count, risk_free_rate, use_bar_magnifier, fill_orders_on_standard_ohlc, max_polylines_count, dynamic_requests, behind_chart) → void

## Arguments

- **`title`** (const string) The title of the script. It is displayed on the chart when no shorttitle argument is used, and becomes the publication's default title when publishing the script.

- **`shorttitle`** (const string) The script's display name on charts. If specified, it will replace the title argument in most chart-related windows. Optional. The default is the argument used for title.

- **`overlay`** (const bool) If true, the script's visuals appear on the main chart pane if the user adds it to the chart directly, or in another script's pane if the user applies it to that script. If false, the script's visuals appear in a separate pane. Changes to the overlay value apply only after the user adds the script to the chart again. Additionally, if the user moves the script to another pane by selecting a "Move to" option in the script's "More" menu, it does not move back to its original pane after any updates to the source code. The default is false. Strategy-specific labels that display entries and exits will be displayed over the main chart regardless of this setting.

- **`format`** (const string) Specifies the formatting of the script's displayed values. Possible values: format.inherit, format.price, format.volume, format.percent. Optional. The default is format.inherit.

- **`precision`** (const int) Specifies the number of digits after the floating point of the script's displayed values. Must be a non-negative integer no greater than 16. If format is set to format.inherit and precision is specified, the format will instead be set to format.price. When the function's format parameter uses format.volume, the precision parameter will not affect the result, as the decimal precision rules defined by format.volume supersede other precision settings. Optional. The default is inherited from the precision of the chart's symbol.

- **`scale`** (const scale_type) The price scale used. Possible values: scale.right, scale.left, scale.none. The scale.none value can only be applied in combination with overlay = true. Optional. By default, the script uses the same scale as the chart.

- **`pyramiding`** (const int) The maximum number of entries allowed in the same direction. If the value is 0, only one entry order in the same direction can be opened, and additional entry orders are rejected. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 0.

- **`calc_on_order_fills`** (const bool) Specifies whether the strategy should be recalculated after an order is filled. If true, the strategy recalculates after an order is filled, as opposed to recalculating only when the bar closes. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is false.

- **`calc_on_every_tick`** (const bool) Specifies whether the strategy should be recalculated on each realtime tick. If true, when the strategy is running on a realtime bar, it will recalculate on each chart update. If false, the strategy only calculates when the realtime bar closes. The argument used does not affect strategy calculation on historical data. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is false.

- **`max_bars_back`** (const int) The length of the historical buffer the script keeps for every variable and function, which determines how many past values can be referenced using the [] history-referencing operator. The required buffer size is automatically detected by the Pine Script® runtime. Using this parameter is only necessary when a runtime error occurs because automatic detection fails. More information on the underlying mechanics of the historical buffer can be found in our Help Center. Optional. The default is 0.

- **`backtest_fill_limits_assumption`** (const int) Limit order execution threshold in ticks. When it is used, limit orders are only filled if the market price exceeds the order's limit level by the specified number of ticks. Optional. The default is 0.

- **`default_qty_type`** (const string) Specifies the units used for default_qty_value. Possible values are: strategy.fixed for contracts/shares/lots, strategy.cash for currency amounts, or strategy.percent_of_equity for a percentage of available equity. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is strategy.fixed.

- **`default_qty_value`** (const int/float) The default quantity to trade, in units determined by the argument used with the default_qty_type parameter. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 1.

- **`initial_capital`** (const int/float) The amount of funds initially available for the strategy to trade, in units of currency. Optional. The default is 1000000.

- **`currency`** (const string) Currency used by the strategy in currency-related calculations. Market positions are still opened by converting currency into the chart symbol's currency. The conversion rate depends on the previous daily value of a corresponding currency pair from the most popular exchange. A spread symbol is used if no exchange provides the rate directly. Possible values: a "string" representing a valid currency code (e.g., "USD" or "USDT") or a constant from the currency.* namespace (e.g., currency.USD or currency.USDT). The default is syminfo.currency.

- **`slippage`** (const int) Slippage expressed in ticks. This value is added to or subtracted from the fill price of market/stop orders to make the fill price less favorable for the strategy. E.g., if syminfo.mintick is 0.01 and slippage is set to 5, a long market order will enter at 5 * 0.01 = 0.05 points above the actual price. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 0.

- **`commission_type`** (const string) Determines what the number passed to the commission_value expresses: strategy.commission.percent for a percentage of the cash volume of the order, strategy.commission.cash_per_contract for currency per contract, strategy.commission.cash_per_order for currency per order. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is strategy.commission.percent.

- **`commission_value`** (const int/float) Commission applied to the strategy's orders in units determined by the argument passed to the commission_type parameter. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is 0.

- **`process_orders_on_close`** (const bool) When set to true, generates an additional attempt to execute orders after a bar closes and strategy calculations are completed. If the orders are market orders, the broker emulator executes them before the next bar's open. If the orders are price-dependent, they will only be filled if the price conditions are met. This option is useful if you wish to close positions on the current bar. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. The default is false.

- **`close_entries_rule`** (const string) Determines the order in which trades are closed. Possible values are: "FIFO" (First-In, First-Out) if the earliest exit order must close the earliest entry order, or "ANY" if the orders are closed based on the from_entry parameter of the strategy.exit() function. "FIFO" can only be used with stocks, futures and US forex (NFA Compliance Rule 2-43b), while "ANY" is allowed in non-US forex. Optional. The default is "FIFO".

- **`margin_long`** (const int/float) Margin long is the percentage of the purchase price of a security that must be covered by cash or collateral for long positions. Must be a non-negative number. The logic used to simulate margin calls is explained in the Help Center. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. If the value is 0, the strategy does not enforce any limits on position size. The default is 100, in which case the strategy only uses its own funds and the long positions cannot be margin called.

- **`margin_short`** (const int/float) Margin short is the percentage of the purchase price of a security that must be covered by cash or collateral for short positions. Must be a non-negative number. The logic used to simulate margin calls is explained in the Help Center. This setting can also be changed in the strategy's "Settings/Properties" tab. Optional. If the value is 0, the strategy does not enforce any limits on position size. The default is 100, in which case the strategy only uses its own funds. Note that even with no margin used, short positions can be margin called if the loss exceeds available funds.

- **`explicit_plot_zorder`** (const bool) Specifies the order in which the script's plots, fills, and hlines are rendered. If true, plots are drawn in the order in which they appear in the script's code, each newer plot being drawn above the previous ones. This only applies to plot*() functions, fill(), and hline(). Optional. The default is false.

- **`max_lines_count`** (const int) The number of last line drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. Optional. The default is 50.

- **`max_labels_count`** (const int) The number of last label drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. Optional. The default is 50.

- **`max_boxes_count`** (const int) The number of last box drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-500. Optional. The default is 50.

- **`calc_bars_count`** (const int) Limits the initial calculation of a script to the last number of bars specified. When specified, a "Calculated bars" field will be included in the "Calculation" section of the script's "Settings/Inputs" tab. Optional. The default is 0, in which case the script executes on all available bars.

- **`risk_free_rate`** (const int/float) The risk-free rate of return is the annual percentage change in the value of an investment with minimal or zero risk. It is used to calculate the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. Optional. The default is 2.

- **`use_bar_magnifier`** (const bool) Optional. When true, the Broker Emulator uses lower timeframe data during backtesting on historical bars to achieve more realistic results. The default is false. Only Premium and higher-tier plans have access to this feature.

- **`fill_orders_on_standard_ohlc`** (const bool) When true, forces strategies running on Heikin Ashi charts to fill orders using actual OHLC prices, for more realistic results. Optional. The default is false.

- **`max_polylines_count`** (const int) The number of last polyline drawings displayed. Possible values: 1-100. The count is approximate; more drawings than the specified count may be displayed. Optional. The default is 50.

- **`dynamic_requests`** (const bool) Specifies whether the script can dynamically call functions from the request.*() namespace. Dynamic request.*() calls are allowed within the local scopes of conditional structures (e.g., if), loops (e.g., for), and exported functions. Additionally, such calls allow "series" arguments for many of their parameters. Optional. The default is true. See the User Manual's Dynamic requests section for more information.

- **`behind_chart`** (const bool) Optional. Controls whether all plots and drawings appear behind the chart display (if true) or in front of it (if false). This parameter only takes effect when the overlay parameter is true. The default is true.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("My strategy", overlay = true)
// Enter long by market if current open is greater than previous high.
if open > high[1]
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, 1)
// Generate a full exit bracket (profit 10 points, loss 5 points per contract) from the entry named "Long".
strategy.exit("Exit", "Long", profit = 10, loss = 5)
```

### Remarks

You can learn more about strategies in our User Manual.

Every strategy script must have one strategy() call.

Strategies using calc_on_every_tick = true parameter may calculate differently on historical and realtime bars, which causes repainting.

Strategies always use the chart's prices to enter and exit positions. Using them on non-standard chart types (Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc.) will produce misleading results, as their prices are synthetic. Backtesting on non-standard charts is thus not recommended.

The maximum number of orders a strategy can open, unless it uses Deep Backtesting mode, is 9000. If the strategy exceeds this limit, it removes the oldest order's information when a new entry appears in the "List of Trades" tab. The strategy.closedtrades.*() functions return na for trades opened or closed by removed orders. To retrieve the index of the oldest available closed trade, use the strategy.closedtrades.first_index variable.

## indicator()
Cancels a pending or unfilled order with a specific identifier. If multiple unfilled orders share the same ID, calling this command with that ID as the id argument cancels all of them. If a script calls this command with an id representing the ID of a filled order, it has no effect.

This command is most useful when working with price-based orders (e.g., limit orders). Calls to this command can also cancel market orders, but only if they execute on the same ticks as the order placement commands.

## Syntax
- **`id`** (series string) The identifier of the unfilled order to cancel.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy(title = "Order cancellation demo")
conditionForBuy = open > high[1]
if conditionForBuy
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long, 1, limit = low) // Enter long using limit order at low price of current bar if `conditionForBuy` is `true`.
if not conditionForBuy
    strategy.cancel("Long") // Cancel the entry order with name "Long" if `conditionForBuy` is `false`.
strategy.cancel_all()
Cancels all pending or unfilled orders, regardless of their identifiers.
This command is most useful when working with price-based orders (e.g., limit orders). Calls to this command can also cancel market orders, but only if they execute on the same ticks as the order placement commands.
Syntax
strategy.cancel_all() → void
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy(title = "Cancel all orders demo")
conditionForBuy1 = open > high[1]
if conditionForBuy1
    strategy.entry("Long entry 1", strategy.long, 1, limit = low) // Enter long using a limit order if `conditionForBuy1` is `true`.
conditionForBuy2 = conditionForBuy1 and open[1] > high[2]
float lowest2 = ta.lowest(low, 2)
if conditionForBuy2
    strategy.entry("Long entry 2", strategy.long, 1, limit = lowest2) // Enter long using a limit order if `conditionForBuy2` is `true`.
conditionForStopTrading = open < lowest2
if conditionForStopTrading
    strategy.cancel_all() // Cancel both limit orders if `conditionForStopTrading` is `true`.
strategy.close()
Creates an order to exit from the part of a position opened by entry orders with a specific identifier. If multiple entries in the position share the same ID, the orders from this command apply to all those entries, starting from the first open trade, when its calls use that ID as the id argument.
This command always generates market orders. To exit from a position using price-based orders (e.g., stop-loss orders), use the strategy.exit() command.
Syntax
strategy.close(id, comment, qty, qty_percent, alert_message, immediately, disable_alert) → void
Arguments
id (series string) The entry identifier of the open trades to close.
comment (series string) Optional. Additional notes on the filled order. If the value is not an empty string, the Strategy Tester and the chart show this text for the order instead of the automatically generated exit identifier. The default is an empty string.
qty (series int/float) Optional. The number of contracts/lots/shares/units to close when an exit order fills. If specified, the command uses this value instead of qty_percent to determine the order size. The default is na, which means the order size depends on the qty_percent value.
qty_percent (series int/float) Optional. A value between 0 and 100 representing the percentage of the open trade quantity to close when an exit order fills. The percentage calculation depends on the total size of the open trades with the id entry identifier. The command ignores this parameter if the qty value is not na. The default is 100.
alert_message (series string) Optional. Custom text for the alert that fires when an order fills. If the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box contains the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder, the alert message replaces the placeholder with this text. The default is an empty string.
immediately (series bool) Optional. If true, the closing order executes on the same tick when the strategy places it, ignoring the strategy properties that restrict execution to the opening tick of the following bar. The default is false.
disable_alert (series bool) Optional. If true when the command creates an order, the strategy does not trigger an alert when that order fills. This parameter accepts a "series" value, meaning users can control which orders trigger alerts when they execute. The default is false.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("Partial close strategy")
// Calculate a 14-bar and 28-bar moving average of `close` prices.
float sma14 = ta.sma(close, 14)
float sma28 = ta.sma(close, 28)
// Place a market order to enter a long position when `sma14` crosses over `sma28`.
if ta.crossover(sma14, sma28)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry ID", strategy.long)
// Place a market order to close the long trade when `sma14` crosses under `sma28`.
if ta.crossunder(sma14, sma28)
    strategy.close("My Long Entry ID", "50% market close", qty_percent = 50)
// Plot the position size.
plot(strategy.position_size)
```

### Remarks

When a position consists of several open trades and the close_entries_rule in the strategy() declaration statement is "FIFO" (default), a strategy.close() call exits from the position starting with the first open trade. This behavior applies even if the id value is the entry ID of different open trades. However, in that case, the maximum exit order size still depends on the trades opened by orders with the id identifier. For more information, see this section of our User Manual.

## strategy.close_all()

Creates an order to close an open position completely, regardless of the identifiers of the entry orders that opened or added to it.

This command always generates market orders. To exit from a position using price-based orders (e.g., stop-loss orders), use the strategy.exit() command.

## Syntax

strategy.close_all(comment, alert_message, immediately, disable_alert) → void

## Arguments

- **`comment`** (series string) Optional. Additional notes on the filled order. If the value is not an empty string, the Strategy Tester and the chart show this text for the order instead of the automatically generated exit identifier. The default is an empty string.

- **`alert_message`** (series string) Optional. Custom text for the alert that fires when an order fills. If the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box contains the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder, the alert message replaces the placeholder with this text. The default is an empty string.

- **`immediately`** (series bool) Optional. If true, the closing order executes on the same tick when the strategy places it, ignoring the strategy properties that restrict execution to the opening tick of the following bar. The default is false.

- **`disable_alert`** (series bool) Optional. If true when the command creates an order, the strategy does not trigger an alert when that order fills. This parameter accepts a "series" value, meaning users can control which orders trigger alerts when they execute. The default is false.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("Multi-entry close strategy")
// Calculate a 14-bar and 28-bar moving average of `close` prices.
float sma14 = ta.sma(close, 14)

// Place a market order to enter a long trade every time `sma14` crosses over `sma28`.
if ta.crossover(sma14, sma28)
    strategy.order("My Long Entry ID " + str.tostring(strategy.opentrades), strategy.long)

    strategy.close_all()
// Plot the position size.
plot(strategy.position_size)
strategy.closedtrades.commission()
Returns the sum of entry and exit fees paid in the closed trade, expressed in strategy.account_currency.

```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6

strategy()
strategy.convert_to_account()
strategy.default_entry_qty()
Calculates the default quantity, in units, of an entry order from strategy.entry() or strategy.order() if it were to fill at the specified fill_price value. The calculation depends on several strategy properties, including default_qty_type, default_qty_value, currency, and other parameters in the strategy() function and their representation in the "Properties" tab of the strategy's settings.
Syntax
strategy.default_entry_qty(fill_price) → series float
Arguments
fill_price (series int/float) The fill price for which to calculate the default order quantity.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("Supertrend Strategy", overlay = true, default_qty_type = strategy.percent_of_equity, default_qty_value = 15)
//@variable The length of the ATR calculation.
atrPeriod = input(10, "ATR Length")
//@variable The ATR multiplier.
factor = input.float(3.0, "Factor", step = 0.01)
//@variable The tick offset of the stop order.
stopOffsetInput = input.int(100, "Tick offset for entry stop")
// Get the direction of the SuperTrend.
[_, direction] = ta.supertrend(factor, atrPeriod)
```

## if ta.change(direction) < 0

    //@variable The stop price of the entry order.

    stopPrice = close + syminfo.mintick * stopOffsetInput

    //@variable The expected default fill quantity at the `stopPrice`. This value may not reflect actual qty of the filled order, because fill price may be different.

##     calculatedQty = strategy.default_entry_qty(stopPrice)

    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long, stop = stopPrice)

    label.new(bar_index, stopPrice, str.format("Stop set at {0}\nExpected qty at {0}: {1}", math.round_to_mintick(stopPrice), calculatedQty))

## if ta.change(direction) > 0

##     strategy.close_all()

### Remarks

This function does not consider open positions simulated by a strategy. For example, if a strategy script has an open position from a long order with a qty of 10 units, using the strategy.entry() function to simulate a short order with a qty of 5 will prompt the script to sell 15 units to reverse the position. This function will still return 5 in such a case since it doesn't consider an open trade.

This value represents the default calculated quantity of an order.

Order placement commands can override the default value by explicitly passing a new qty value in the function call.

## strategy.entry()

Creates a new order to open or add to a position. If an unfilled order with the same id exists, a call to this command modifies that order.

The resulting order's type depends on the limit and stop parameters. If the call does not contain limit or stop arguments, it creates a market order that executes on the next tick. If the call specifies a limit value but no stop value, it places a limit order that executes after the market price reaches the limit value or a better price (lower for buy orders and higher for sell orders). If the call specifies a stop value but no limit value, it places a stop order that executes after the market price reaches the stop value or a worse price (higher for buy orders and lower for sell orders). If the call contains limit and stop arguments, it creates a stop-limit order, which generates a limit order at the limit price only after the market price reaches the stop value or a worse price.

Orders from this command, unlike those from strategy.order(), are affected by the pyramiding parameter of the strategy() declaration statement. Pyramiding specifies the number of concurrent open entries allowed per position. For example, with pyramiding = 3, the strategy can have up to three open trades, and the command cannot create orders to open additional trades until at least one existing trade closes.

By default, when a strategy executes an order from this command in the opposite direction of the current market position, it reverses that position. For example, if there is an open long position of five shares, an order from this command with a qty of 5 and a direction of strategy.short triggers the sale of 10 shares to close the long position and open a new five-share short position. Users can change this behavior by specifying an allowed direction with the strategy.risk_allow_entry_in() function.

## Syntax

strategy.entry(id, direction, qty, limit, stop, oca_name, oca_type, comment, alert_message, disable_alert) → void

## Arguments

- **`id`** (series string) The identifier of the order, which corresponds to an entry ID in the strategy's trades after the order fills. If the strategy opens a new position after filling the order, the order's ID becomes the strategy.position_entry_name value. Strategy commands can reference the order ID to cancel or modify pending orders and generate exit orders for specific open trades. The Strategy Tester and the chart display the order ID unless the command specifies a comment value.

- **`direction`** (series strategy_direction) The direction of the trade. Possible values: strategy.long for a long trade, strategy.short for a short one.

- **`qty`** (series int/float) Optional. The number of contracts/shares/lots/units in the resulting open trade when the order fills. The default is na, which means that the command uses the default_qty_type and default_qty_value parameters of the strategy() declaration statement to determine the quantity.

- **`limit`** (series int/float) Optional. The limit price of the order. If specified, the command creates a limit or stop-limit order, depending on whether the stop value is also specified. The default is na, which means the resulting order is not of the limit or stop-limit type.

- **`stop`** (series int/float) Optional. The stop price of the order. If specified, the command creates a stop or stop-limit order, depending on whether the limit value is also specified. The default is na, which means the resulting order is not of the stop or stop-limit type.

- **`oca_name`** (series string) Optional. The name of the order's One-Cancels-All (OCA) group. When a pending order with the same oca_name and oca_type parameters executes, that order affects all unfilled orders in the group. The default is an empty string, which means the order does not belong to an OCA group.

- **`oca_type`** (input string) Optional. Specifies how an unfilled order behaves when another pending order with the same oca_name and oca_type values executes. Possible values: strategy.oca.cancel, strategy.oca.reduce, strategy.oca.none. The default is strategy.oca.none.

- **`comment`** (series string) Optional. Additional notes on the filled order. If the value is not an empty string, the Strategy Tester and the chart show this text for the order instead of the specified id. The default is an empty string.

- **`alert_message`** (series string) Optional. Custom text for the alert that fires when an order fills. If the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box contains the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder, the alert message replaces the placeholder with this text. The default is an empty string.

- **`disable_alert`** (series bool) Optional. If true when the command creates an order, the strategy does not trigger an alert when that order fills. This parameter accepts a "series" value, meaning users can control which orders trigger alerts when they execute. The default is false.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("Market order strategy", overlay = true)
// Calculate a 14-bar and 28-bar moving average of `close` prices.
float sma14 = ta.sma(close, 14)
float sma28 = ta.sma(close, 28)
// Place a market order to close the short trade and enter a long position when `sma14` crosses over `sma28`.
if ta.crossover(sma14, sma28)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry ID", strategy.long)
// Place a market order to close the long trade and enter a short position when `sma14` crosses under `sma28`.
if ta.crossunder(sma14, sma28)
    strategy.entry("My Short Entry ID", strategy.short)
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("Limit order strategy", overlay=true, margin_long=100, margin_short=100)
//@variable The distance from the `close` price for each limit order.
float limitOffsetInput = input.int(100, "Limit offset, in ticks", 1) * syminfo.mintick
//@function Draws a label and line at the specified `price` to visualize a limit order's level.
drawLimit(float price, bool isLong) =>
    color col = isLong ? color.blue : color.red
    label.new(
         bar_index, price, (isLong ? "Long" : "Short") + " limit order created",
         style = label.style_label_right, color = col, textcolor = color.white
     )
    line.new(bar_index, price, bar_index + 1, price, extend = extend.right, style = line.style_dashed, color = col)
//@function Stops the `l` line from extending further.
method stopExtend(line l) =>
    l.set_x2(bar_index)
    l.set_extend(extend.none)
// Initialize two `line` variables to reference limit line IDs.
var line longLimit  = na
var line shortLimit = na
// Calculate a 14-bar and 28-bar moving average of `close` prices.
float sma14 = ta.sma(close, 14)
float sma28 = ta.sma(close, 28)
```

## if ta.crossover(sma14, sma28)

    // Cancel any unfilled sell orders with the specified ID.

##     strategy.cancel("My Short Entry ID")

    //@variable The limit price level. Its value is `limitOffsetInput` ticks below the current `close`.

    float limitLevel = close - limitOffsetInput

    // Place a long limit order to close the short trade and enter a long position at the `limitLevel`.

    strategy.entry("My Long Entry ID", strategy.long, limit = limitLevel)

    // Make new drawings for the long limit and stop extending the `shortLimit` line.

    longLimit := drawLimit(limitLevel, isLong = true)

##     shortLimit.stopExtend()

## if ta.crossunder(sma14, sma28)

    // Cancel any unfilled buy orders with the specified ID.

##     strategy.cancel("My Long Entry ID")

    //@variable The limit price level. Its value is `limitOffsetInput` ticks above the current `close`.

    float limitLevel = close + limitOffsetInput

    // Place a short limit order to close the long trade and enter a short position at the `limitLevel`.

    strategy.entry("My Short Entry ID", strategy.short, limit = limitLevel)

    // Make new drawings for the short limit and stop extending the `shortLimit` line.

    shortLimit := drawLimit(limitLevel, isLong = false)

##     longLimit.stopExtend()

## strategy.exit()

Creates price-based orders to exit from an open position. If unfilled exit orders with the same id exist, calls to this command modify those orders. This command can generate more than one type of exit order, depending on the specified parameters. However, it does not create market orders. To exit from a position with a market order, use strategy.close() or strategy.close_all().

If a call to this command contains a profit or limit argument, it creates take-profit orders to exit from applicable trades at the determined price levels or better values (higher for long trades and lower for short ones). If the call contains loss or stop arguments, it creates stop-loss orders to exit from applicable trades at the determined levels or worse values (lower for long trades and higher for short ones). Calling this command with profit or limit and loss or stop arguments creates an order bracket with both order types.

This command can create trailing stop orders when its call specifies a trail_price or trail_points argument and a trail_offset argument. A trailing stop order activates when the price moves trail_points ticks past the entry price or touches the trail_price level. Once activated, the stop follows trail_offset ticks behind the market price each time the trade's profit reaches a new high. The stop does not move when the trade does not achieve a new best value.

Each call to this command reserves a portion of the position to close until the strategy fills or cancels its orders. For example, if there is an open position of 50 contracts and a strategy.exit() call specifies a qty of 20, that call's orders reserve 20 contracts out of the position. A second call can close a maximum of 30 contracts, even if its qty is 50 and one of its orders executes first. This behavior does not affect the orders from other commands, such as strategy.close() or strategy.order().

If a call to this command occurs before a created entry order's execution, the strategy waits and does not create the exit orders until after the entry order executes.

## Syntax

strategy.exit(id, from_entry, qty, qty_percent, profit, limit, loss, stop, trail_price, trail_points, trail_offset, oca_name, comment, comment_profit, comment_loss, comment_trailing, alert_message, alert_profit, alert_loss, alert_trailing, disable_alert) → void

## Arguments

- **`id`** (series string) The identifier of the orders, which corresponds to an exit ID in the strategy's trades after an order fills. Strategy commands can reference the order ID to cancel or modify pending exit orders. The Strategy Tester and the chart display the order ID unless the command includes a comment* argument that applies to the filled order.

- **`from_entry`** (series string) Optional. The entry order ID of the trade to exit from. If there is more than one open trade with the specified entry ID, the command generates exit orders for all the entries from before or at the time of the call. The default is an empty string, which means the command generates exit orders for all open trades until the position closes.

- **`qty`** (series int/float) Optional. The number of contracts/lots/shares/units to close when an exit order fills. If specified, the command uses this value instead of qty_percent to determine the order size. The exit orders reserve this quantity from the position, meaning other calls to this command cannot close this portion until the strategy fills or cancels those orders. The default is na, which means the order size depends on the qty_percent value.

- **`qty_percent`** (series int/float) Optional. A value between 0 and 100 representing the percentage of the open trade quantity to close when an exit order fills. The exit orders reserve this percentage from the applicable open trades, meaning other calls to this command cannot close this portion until the strategy fills or cancels those orders. The percentage calculation depends on the total size of the applicable open trades without considering the reserved amount from other strategy.exit() calls. The command ignores this parameter if the qty value is not na. The default is 100.

- **`profit`** (series int/float) Optional. The take-profit distance, expressed in ticks. If specified, the command creates a limit order to exit the trade profit ticks away from the entry price in the favorable direction. The order executes at the calculated price or a better value. If this parameter and limit are not na, the command places a take-profit order only at the price level expected to trigger an exit first. The default is na.

- **`limit`** (series int/float) Optional. The take-profit price. If this parameter and profit are not na, the command places a take-profit order only at the price level expected to trigger an exit first. The default is na.

- **`loss`** (series int/float) Optional. The stop-loss distance, expressed in ticks. If specified, the command creates a stop order to exit the trade loss ticks away from the entry price in the unfavorable direction. The order executes at the calculated price or a worse value. If this parameter and stop are not na, the command places a stop-loss order only at the price level expected to trigger an exit first. The default is na.

- **`stop`** (series int/float) Optional. The stop-loss price. If this parameter and loss are not na, the command places a stop-loss order only at the price level expected to trigger an exit first. The default is na.

- **`trail_price`** (series int/float) Optional. The price of the trailing stop activation level. If the value is more favorable than the entry price, the command creates a trailing stop when the market price reaches that value. If less favorable than the entry price, the command creates the trailing stop immediately when the current market price is equal to or more favorable than the value. If this parameter and trail_points are not na, the command sets the activation level using the value expected to activate the stop first. The default is na.

- **`trail_points`** (series int/float) Optional. The trailing stop activation distance, expressed in ticks. If the value is positive, the command creates a trailing stop order when the market price moves trail_points ticks away from the trade's entry price in the favorable direction. If the value is negative, the command creates the trailing stop immediately when the market price is equal to or more favorable than the level trail_points ticks away from the entry price in the unfavorable direction. The default is na.

- **`trail_offset`** (series int/float) Optional. The trailing stop offset. When the market price reaches the activation level determined by the trail_price or trail_points parameter, or exceeds the level in the favorable direction, the command creates a trailing stop with an initial value trail_offset ticks away from that level in the unfavorable direction. After activation, the trailing stop moves toward the market price each time the trade's profit reaches a better value, maintaining the specified distance behind the best price. The default is na.

- **`oca_name`** (series string) Optional. The name of the One-Cancels-All (OCA) group that the command's take-profit, stop-loss, and trailing stop orders belong to. All orders from this command are of the strategy.oca.reduce OCA type. When an order of this OCA type with the same oca_name executes, the strategy reduces the sizes of other unfilled orders in the OCA group by the filled quantity. The default is an empty string, which means the strategy assigns the OCA name automatically, and the resulting orders cannot reduce or be reduced by the orders from other commands.

- **`comment`** (series string) Optional. Additional notes on the filled order. If the value is not an empty string, the Strategy Tester and the chart show this text for the order instead of the specified id. The command ignores this value if the call includes an argument for a comment_* parameter that applies to the order. The default is an empty string.

- **`comment_profit`** (series string) Optional. Additional notes on the filled order. If the value is not an empty string, the Strategy Tester and the chart show this text for the order instead of the specified id or comment. This comment applies only to the command's take-profit orders created using the profit or limit parameter. The default is an empty string.

- **`comment_loss`** (series string) Optional. Additional notes on the filled order. If the value is not an empty string, the Strategy Tester and the chart show this text for the order instead of the specified id or comment. This comment applies only to the command's stop-loss orders created using the loss or stop parameter. The default is an empty string.

- **`comment_trailing`** (series string) Optional. Additional notes on the filled order. If the value is not an empty string, the Strategy Tester and the chart show this text for the order instead of the specified id or comment. This comment applies only to the command's trailing stop orders created using the trail_price or trail_points and trail_offset parameters. The default is an empty string.

- **`alert_message`** (series string) Optional. Custom text for the alert that fires when an order fills. If the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box contains the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder, the alert message replaces the placeholder with this text. The command ignores this value if the call includes an argument for the other alert_* parameter that applies to the order. The default is an empty string.

- **`alert_profit`** (series string) Optional. Custom text for the alert that fires when an order fills. If the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box contains the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder, the alert message replaces the placeholder with this text. This message applies only to the command's take-profit orders created using the profit or limit parameter. The default is an empty string.

- **`alert_loss`** (series string) Optional. Custom text for the alert that fires when an order fills. If the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box contains the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder, the alert message replaces the placeholder with this text. This message applies only to the command's stop-loss orders created using the loss or stop parameter. The default is an empty string.

- **`alert_trailing`** (series string) Optional. Custom text for the alert that fires when an order fills. If the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box contains the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder, the alert message replaces the placeholder with this text. This message applies only to the command's trailing stop orders created using the trail_price or trail_points and trail_offset parameters. The default is an empty string.

- **`disable_alert`** (series bool) Optional. If true when the command creates an order, the strategy does not trigger an alert when that order fills. This parameter accepts a "series" value, meaning users can control which orders trigger alerts when they execute. The default is false.

### Remarks

A single call to the strategy.exit() command can generate exit orders for several entries in an open position, depending on the call's from_entry value. If the call does not include a from_entry argument, it creates exit orders for all open trades, even the ones opened after the call, until the position closes. See this section of our User Manual to learn more.

When a position consists of several open trades, and the close_entries_rule in the strategy() declaration statement is "FIFO" (default), the orders from a strategy.exit() call exit from the position starting with the first open trade. This behavior applies even if the from_entry value is the entry ID of different open trades. However, in that case, the maximum size of the exit orders still depends on the trades opened by orders with the from_entry ID. For more information, see this section of our User Manual.

If a strategy.exit() call includes arguments for creating stop-loss and trailing stop orders, the command places only the order that is supposed to fill first, because both orders are of the "stop" type.

strategy.order()
Creates a new order to open, add to, or exit from a position. If an unfilled order with the same id exists, a call to this command modifies that order.
The resulting order's type depends on the limit and stop parameters. If the call does not contain limit or stop arguments, it creates a market order that executes on the next tick. If the call specifies a limit value but no stop value, it places a limit order that executes after the market price reaches the limit value or a better price (lower for buy orders and higher for sell orders). If the call specifies a stop value but no limit value, it places a stop order that executes after the market price reaches the stop value or a worse price (higher for buy orders and lower for sell orders). If the call contains limit and stop arguments, it creates a stop-limit order, which generates a limit order at the limit price only after the market price reaches the stop value or a worse price.
Orders from this command, unlike those from strategy.entry(), are not affected by the pyramiding parameter of the strategy() declaration statement. Strategies can open any number of trades in the same direction with calls to this function.
This command does not automatically reverse open positions because it does not exclusively create entry orders like strategy.entry() does. For example, if there is an open long position of five shares, an order from this command with a qty of 5 and a direction of strategy.short triggers the sale of five shares, which closes the position.
Syntax
strategy.order(id, direction, qty, limit, stop, oca_name, oca_type, comment, alert_message, disable_alert) → void
Arguments
id (series string) The identifier of the order, which corresponds to an entry or exit ID in the strategy's trades after the order fills. If the strategy opens a new position after filling the order, the order's ID becomes the strategy.position_entry_name value. Strategy commands can reference the order ID to cancel or modify pending orders and generate exit orders for specific open trades. The Strategy Tester and the chart display the order ID unless the command specifies a comment value.
direction (series strategy_direction) The direction of the trade. Possible values: strategy.long for a long trade, strategy.short for a short one.
qty (series int/float) Optional. The number of contracts/shares/lots/units to trade when the order fills. The default is na, which means that the command uses the default_qty_type and default_qty_value parameters of the strategy() declaration statement to determine the quantity.
limit (series int/float) Optional. The limit price of the order. If specified, the command creates a limit or stop-limit order, depending on whether the stop value is also specified. The default is na, which means the resulting order is not of the limit or stop-limit type.
stop (series int/float) Optional. The stop price of the order. If specified, the command creates a stop or stop-limit order, depending on whether the limit value is also specified. The default is na, which means the resulting order is not of the stop or stop-limit type.
oca_name (series string) Optional. The name of the order's One-Cancels-All (OCA) group. When a pending order with the same oca_name and oca_type parameters executes, that order affects all unfilled orders in the group. The default is an empty string, which means the order does not belong to an OCA group.
oca_type (input string) Optional. Specifies how an unfilled order behaves when another pending order with the same oca_name and oca_type values executes. Possible values: strategy.oca.cancel, strategy.oca.reduce, strategy.oca.none. The default is strategy.oca.none.
comment (series string) Optional. Additional notes on the filled order. If the value is not an empty string, the Strategy Tester and the chart show this text for the order instead of the specified id. The default is an empty string.
alert_message (series string) Optional. Custom text for the alert that fires when an order fills. If the "Message" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box contains the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder, the alert message replaces the placeholder with this text. The default is an empty string.
disable_alert (series bool) Optional. If true when the command creates an order, the strategy does not trigger an alert when that order fills. This parameter accepts a "series" value, meaning users can control which orders trigger alerts when they execute. The default is false.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("Market order strategy", overlay = true)
// Calculate a 14-bar and 28-bar moving average of `close` prices.
float sma14 = ta.sma(close, 14)
float sma28 = ta.sma(close, 28)
// Place a market order to enter a long position when `sma14` crosses over `sma28`.
if ta.crossover(sma14, sma28) and strategy.position_size == 0
    strategy.order("My Long Entry ID", strategy.long)
// Place a market order to sell the same quantity as the long trade when `sma14` crosses under `sma28`,
// effectively closing the long position.
if ta.crossunder(sma14, sma28) and strategy.position_size > 0
    strategy.order("My Long Exit ID", strategy.short)
```

### Example

    float profitLevel = entryPrice + shortOffsetInput
    float lossLevel   = entryPrice - shortOffsetInput
    // Place short limit and stop orders at the `profitLevel` and `lossLevel`.

```

## if ta.change(strategy.closedtrades) > 0

    // Stop extending the `profitLimit` and `lossStop` lines.

##     profitLimit.stopExtend()
This function can be used to specify in which market direction the strategy.entry() function is allowed to open positions.

## Syntax
- **`value`** (simple string) The allowed direction. Possible values: strategy.direction.all, strategy.direction.long, strategy.direction.short

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("strategy.risk.allow_entry_in")
```

## strategy.risk.allow_entry_in(strategy.direction.long)

if open > close

##     strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)

// Instead of opening a short position with 10 contracts, this command will close long entries.

if open < close

##     strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short, qty = 10)

## strategy.risk.max_cons_loss_days()

The purpose of this rule is to cancel all pending orders, close all open positions and stop placing orders after a specified number of consecutive days with losses. The rule affects the whole strategy.

## Syntax
- **`count`** (simple int) A required parameter. The allowed number of consecutive days with losses.

- **`alert_message`** (simple string) An optional parameter which replaces the {{strategy.order.alert_message}} placeholder when it is used in the "Create Alert" dialog box's "Message" field.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("risk.max_cons_loss_days Demo 1")
strategy.risk.max_cons_loss_days(3) // No orders will be placed after 3 days, if each day is with loss.
plot(strategy.position_size)
strategy.risk.max_drawdown()
The purpose of this rule is to determine maximum drawdown. The rule affects the whole strategy. Once the maximum drawdown value is reached, all pending orders are cancelled, all open positions are closed and no new orders can be placed.
Syntax
strategy.risk.max_drawdown(value, type, alert_message) → void

timeframe = "1W"
typeInput = input.string("Traditional", "Type", options=["Traditional", "Fibonacci", "Woodie", "Classic", "DM", "Camarilla"])
weekChange = timeframe.change(timeframe)
pivotPointsArray = ta.pivot_point_levels(typeInput, weekChange)

```

### Returns

- **`An array<float> with numerical values representing 11 pivot point levels: [P, R1, S1, R2, S2, R3, S3, R4, S4, R5, S5]. Levels absent from the specified type return na values`** (e.g., "DM" only calculates P, R1, and S1).

### Remarks

The developing parameter cannot be true when type is set to "Woodie", because the Woodie calculation for a period depends on that period's open, which means that the pivot value is either available or unavailable, but never developing. If used together, the indicator will return a runtime error.

- **`source`** (series int/float) Series of values to process.

- **`length`** (series int) Number of bars (length).

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("ta.vwma")
plot(ta.vwma(close, 15))
// same on pine, but less efficient
pine_vwma(x, y) =>
    ta.sma(x * volume, y) / ta.sma(volume, y)
plot(pine_vwma(close, 15))
```

### Returns

Volume-weighted moving average of source for length bars back.

### Remarks

na values in the source series are ignored.

## ta.sma()
The wma function returns weighted moving average of source for length bars back. In wma weighting factors decrease in arithmetical progression.

## Syntax
- **`source`** (series int/float) Series of values to process.

- **`length`** (series int) Number of bars (length).

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("ta.wma")
plot(ta.wma(close, 15))
// same on pine, but much less efficient
pine_wma(x, y) =>
    norm = 0.0
    sum = 0.0
    for i = 0 to y - 1
        weight = (y - i) * y
        norm := norm + weight
        sum := sum + x[i] * weight
    sum / norm
plot(pine_wma(close, 15))
```

### Returns

Weighted moving average of source for length bars back.

### Remarks

na values in the source series are ignored.

## ta.sma()
Williams %R. The oscillator shows the current closing price in relation to the high and low of the past 'length' bars.

## Syntax
- **`length`** (series int) Number of bars.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Williams %R", shorttitle="%R", format=format.price, precision=2)
plot(ta.wpr(14), title="%R", color=color.new(#ff6d00, 0))
```

### Returns

Williams %R.

### Remarks

na values in the source series are ignored.

## ta.mfi()

## Syntax
- **`x`** (series table) The value to convert to the specified type, usually na.

### Returns

The value of the argument after casting to table.

## float()
The function defines a cell in the table and sets its attributes.

## Syntax

table.cell(table_id, column, row, text, width, height, text_color, text_halign, text_valign, text_size, bgcolor, tooltip, text_font_family, text_formatting) → void

## Arguments

- **`table_id`** (series table) A table object.

- **`column`** (series int) The index of the cell's column. Numbering starts at 0.

- **`row`** (series int) The index of the cell's row. Numbering starts at 0.

- **`text`** (series string) The text to be displayed inside the cell. Optional. The default is empty string.

- **`width`** (series int/float) The width of the cell as a % of the indicator's visual space. Optional. By default, auto-adjusts the width based on the text inside the cell. Value 0 has the same effect.

- **`height`** (series int/float) The height of the cell as a % of the indicator's visual space. Optional. By default, auto-adjusts the height based on the text inside of the cell. Value 0 has the same effect.

- **`text_color`** (series color) The color of the text. Optional. The default is color.black.

- **`text_halign`** (series string) The horizontal alignment of the cell's text. Optional. The default value is text.align_center. Possible values: text.align_left, text.align_center, text.align_right.

- **`text_valign`** (series string) The vertical alignment of the cell's text. Optional. The default value is text.align_center. Possible values: text.align_top, text.align_center, text.align_bottom.

- **`text_size`** (series int/string) Size of the object. The size can be any positive integer, or one of the size.* built-in constant strings. The constant strings and their equivalent integer values are: size.auto (0), size.tiny (8), size.small (10), size.normal (14), size.large (20), size.huge (36). The default value is size.normal or 14.

- **`bgcolor`** (series color) The background color of the text. Optional. The default is no color.

- **`text_font_family`** (series string) The font family of the text. Optional. The default value is font.family_default. Possible values: font.family_default, font.family_monospace.

- **`text_formatting`** (const text_format) The formatting of the displayed text. Formatting options support addition. For example, text.format_bold + text.format_italic will make the text both bold and italicized. Possible values: text.format_none, text.format_bold, text.format_italic. Optional. The default is text.format_none.

### Remarks

This function does not create the table itself, but defines the table’s cells. To use it, you first need to create a table object with table.new().

Each table.cell() call overwrites all previously defined properties of a cell. If you call table.cell() twice in a row, e.g., the first time with text='Test Text', and the second time with text_color=color.red but without a new text argument, the default value of the 'text' being an empty string, it will overwrite 'Test Text', and your cell will display an empty string. If you want, instead, to modify any of the cell's properties, use the table.cell_set_*() functions.

- **`A single script can only display one table in each of the possible locations. If table.cell() is used on several bars to change the same attribute of a cell`** (e.g. change the background color of the cell to red on the first bar, then to yellow on the second bar), only the last change will be reflected in the table, i.e., the cell’s background will be yellow. Avoid unnecessary setting of cell properties by enclosing function calls in an if barstate.islast block whenever possible, to restrict their execution to the last bar of the series.

## table.cell_set_bgcolor()
The function sets the background color of the cell.

## Syntax

table.cell_set_bgcolor(table_id, column, row, bgcolor) → void

## Arguments

- **`table_id`** (series table) A table object.

- **`column`** (series int) The index of the cell's column. Numbering starts at 0.

- **`row`** (series int) The index of the cell's row. Numbering starts at 0.

- **`bgcolor`** (series color) The background color of the cell.

## table.cell_set_height()
The function sets the height of cell.

## Syntax

table.cell_set_height(table_id, column, row, height) → void

## Arguments

- **`table_id`** (series table) A table object.

- **`column`** (series int) The index of the cell's column. Numbering starts at 0.

- **`row`** (series int) The index of the cell's row. Numbering starts at 0.

- **`height`** (series int/float) The height of the cell as a % of the chart window. Passing 0 auto-adjusts the height based on the text inside of the cell.

## table.cell_set_bgcolor()
The function sets the text in the specified cell.

### Remarks

This function will merge cells, even if their properties are not yet defined with table.cell().

The resulting merged cell inherits all of its values from the cell located at start_column:start_row, except width and height. The width and height of the resulting merged cell are based on the width/height of other cells in the neighboring columns/rows and cannot be set manually.

To modify the merged cell with any of the table.cell_set_* functions, target the cell at the start_column:start_row coordinates.

An attempt to merge a cell that has already been merged will result in an error.

## table.delete()
The function creates a new table.

## Syntax

table.new(position, columns, rows, bgcolor, frame_color, frame_width, border_color, border_width, force_overlay) → series table

## Arguments

- **`columns`** (series int) The number of columns in the table.

- **`rows`** (series int) The number of rows in the table.

- **`bgcolor`** (series color) The background color of the table. Optional. The default is no color.

- **`frame_color`** (series color) The color of the outer frame of the table. Optional. The default is no color.

- **`frame_width`** (series int) The width of the outer frame of the table. Optional. The default is 0.

- **`border_color`** (series color) The color of the borders of the cells (excluding the outer frame). Optional. The default is no color.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("table.new example")
var testTable = table.new(position = position.top_right, columns = 2, rows = 1, bgcolor = color.yellow, border_width = 1)
if barstate.islast
    table.cell(table_id = testTable, column = 0, row = 0, text = "Open is " + str.tostring(open))
    table.cell(table_id = testTable, column = 1, row = 0, text = "Close is " + str.tostring(close), bgcolor=color.teal)
```

### Returns

The ID of a table object that can be passed to other table.*() functions.

### Remarks

This function creates the table object itself, but the table will not be displayed until its cells are populated. To define a cell and change its contents or attributes, use table.cell() and other table.cell_*() functions.

One table.new() call can only display one table (the last one drawn), but the function itself will be recalculated on each bar it is used on. For performance reasons, it is wise to use table.new() in conjunction with either the var keyword (so the table object is only created on the first bar) or in an if barstate.islast block (so the table object is only created on the last bar).

## table.cell()
The function sets the background color of a table.

## Syntax
- **`table_id`** (series table) A table object.

- **`bgcolor`** (series color) The background color of the table. Optional. The default is no color.

- **`border_color`** (series color) The color of the borders. Optional. The default is no color.

## table.clear()
The function sets the width of the borders (excluding the outer frame) of the table's cells.

## Syntax

- **`border_width`** (series int) The width of the borders. Optional. The default is 0.

## table.clear()
The function sets the color of the outer frame of a table.

## Syntax
- **`table_id`** (series table) A table object.

- **`frame_color`** (series color) The color of the frame of the table. Optional. The default is no color.

## table.clear()
The function set the width of the outer frame of a table.

## Syntax
- **`table_id`** (series table) A table object.

- **`frame_width`** (series int) The width of the outer frame of the table. Optional. The default is 0.

## table.clear()
Creates a ticker identifier for requesting Heikin Ashi bar values.

Syntax & Overloads

## ticker.heikinashi(symbol) → simple string
- **`symbol`** (simple string) Symbol ticker identifier.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("ticker.heikinashi", overlay=true)
heikinashi_close = request.security(ticker.heikinashi(syminfo.tickerid), timeframe.period, close)
```

## heikinashi_aapl_60_close = request.security(ticker.heikinashi("AAPL"), "60", close)
### Returns

String value of ticker id, that can be supplied to request.security() function.

## syminfo.tickerid
Constructs a ticker ID for the specified symbol with additional parameters inherited from the ticker ID passed into the function call, allowing the script to request a symbol's data using the same modifiers that the from_tickerid has, including extended session, dividend adjustment, currency conversion, non-standard chart types, back-adjustment, settlement-as-close, etc.

Syntax & Overloads

## ticker.inherit(from_tickerid, symbol) → simple string
- **`from_tickerid`** (simple string) The ticker ID to inherit modifiers from.

- **`symbol`** (simple string) The symbol to construct the new ticker ID for.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("ticker.inherit")
//@variable A "NASDAQ:AAPL" ticker ID with Extender Hours enabled.
tickerExtHours = ticker.new("NASDAQ", "AAPL", session.extended)
//@variable A Heikin Ashi ticker ID for "NASDAQ:AAPL" with Extended Hours enabled.
HAtickerExtHours = ticker.heikinashi(tickerExtHours)
//@variable The "NASDAQ:MSFT" symbol with no modifiers.
testSymbol = "NASDAQ:MSFT"
//@variable A ticker ID for "NASDAQ:MSFT" with inherited Heikin Ashi and Extended Hours modifiers.
testSymbolHAtickerExtHours = ticker.inherit(HAtickerExtHours, testSymbol)
//@variable The `close` price requested using "NASDAQ:MSFT" with inherited modifiers.
secData = request.security(testSymbolHAtickerExtHours, "60", close, ignore_invalid_symbol = true)
//@variable The `close` price requested using "NASDAQ:MSFT" without modifiers.
compareData = request.security(testSymbol, "60", close, ignore_invalid_symbol = true)
```

## plot(secData, color = color.green)

## plot(compareData)

### Remarks

- **`If the constructed ticker ID inherits a modifier that doesn't apply to the symbol`** (e.g., if the from_tickerid has Extended Hours enabled, but no such option is available for the symbol), the script will ignore the modifier when requesting data using the ID.

## ticker.kagi()4 overloads

```

### Returns

String value of ticker id, that can be supplied to request.security() function.

## syminfo.tickerid
Creates a ticker to request data from a standard chart that is unaffected by modifiers like extended session, dividend adjustment, currency conversion, and the calculations of non-standard chart types: Heikin Ashi, Renko, etc. Among other things, this makes it possible to retrieve standard chart values when the script is running on a non-standard chart.

Syntax & Overloads

// This script should be run on a non-standard chart such as HA, Renko...
// Requests data from the chart type the script is running on.
chartTypeValue = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "1D", close)
// Request data from the standard chart type, regardless of the chart type the script is running on.
standardChartValue = request.security(ticker.standard(syminfo.tickerid), "1D", close)
// This will not use a standard ticker ID because the `symbol` argument contains only the ticker — not the prefix (exchange).
standardChartValue2 = request.security(ticker.standard(syminfo.ticker), "1D", close)
```

## plot(chartTypeValue)

## plot(standardChartValue, color = color.green)

### Returns

A string representing the ticker of a standard chart in the "prefix:ticker" format. If the symbol argument does not contain the prefix and ticker information, the function returns the supplied argument as is.

## request.security()

## time()2 overloads

The time function returns the UNIX time of the current bar for the specified timeframe and session or NaN if the time point is out of session.

Syntax & Overloads

time(timeframe, session, bars_back, timeframe_bars_back) → series int

time(timeframe, session, timezone, bars_back, timeframe_bars_back) → series int

## Arguments

- **`timeframe`** (series string) Timeframe. An empty string is interpreted as the current timeframe of the chart.

- **`session`** (series string) Session specification. Optional argument, session of the symbol is used by default. An empty string is interpreted as the session of the symbol.

- **`bars_back`** (series int) Optional. The bar offset on the script's main timeframe. If the value is positive, the function retrieves the timestamp of the bar N bars back relative to the current bar on the main timeframe. If the value is a negative number from -1 to -500, the function retrieves the expected time of a future bar on that timeframe. The default is 0.

- **`timeframe_bars_back`** (series int) Optional. The bar offset on the timeframe specified by the timeframe parameter. If the value is positive, the function retrieves the timestamp of the bar N bars back relative to the bar on the specified timeframe. If the value is a negative number from -1 to -500, the function retrieves the expected time of a future bar on that timeframe. The default is 0.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Time", overlay=true)
// Try this on chart AAPL,1
timeinrange(res, sess) => not na(time(res, sess, "America/New_York")) ? 1 : 0
plot(timeinrange("1", "1300-1400"), color=color.red)
// This plots 1.0 at every start of 10 minute bar on a 1 minute chart:
newbar(res) => ta.change(time(res)) == 0 ? 0 : 1
plot(newbar("10"))
While setting up a session you can specify not just the hours and minutes but also the days of the week that will be included in that session.
If the days aren't specified, the session is considered to have been set from Sunday (1) to Saturday (7), i.e. "1100-2000" is the same as "1100-1200:1234567".
You can change that by specifying the days. For example, on a symbol that is traded seven days a week with the 24-hour trading session the following script will not color Saturdays and Sundays:
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Time", overlay=true)
t1 = time(timeframe.period, "0000-0000:23456")
bgcolor(not na(t1) ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : na)
One session argument can include several different sessions, separated by commas. For example, the following script will highlight the bars from 10:00 to 11:00 and from 14:00 to 15:00 (workdays only):
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Time", overlay=true)
t1 = time(timeframe.period, "1000-1100,1400-1500:23456")
bgcolor(not na(t1) ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : na)
```

### Returns

UNIX time.

### Remarks

UNIX time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

If the function call includes bars_back and timeframe_bars_back arguments, it evaluates the bars_back offset before the timeframe_bars_back offset. For example, consider the call time(timeframe = "1M", bars_back = 15, timeframe_bars_back = 10) on a "1D" chart. This function call references the bar from 15 bars back on the "1D" timeframe, determines the "1M" bar that the bar belongs to, and then retrieves the timestamp from 10 "1M" bars back relative to that "1M" bar.

## time

## time_close()2 overloads

- **`Returns the UNIX time of the current bar's close for the specified timeframe and session, or na if the time point is outside the session. On tick charts and price-based charts such as Renko, line break, Kagi, point & figure, and range, this function returns an na timestamp for the latest realtime bar`** (because the future closing time is unpredictable), but a valid timestamp for any previous bar.

Syntax & Overloads

time_close(timeframe, session, bars_back, timeframe_bars_back) → series int

time_close(timeframe, session, timezone, bars_back, timeframe_bars_back) → series int

## Arguments

- **`timeframe`** (series string) Resolution. An empty string is interpreted as the current resolution of the chart.

- **`session`** (series string) Session specification. Optional argument, session of the symbol is used by default. An empty string is interpreted as the session of the symbol.

- **`bars_back`** (series int) Optional. The bar offset on the script's main timeframe. If the value is positive, the function retrieves the timestamp of the bar N bars back relative to the current bar on the main timeframe. If the value is a negative number from -1 to -500, the function retrieves the expected time of a future bar on that timeframe. The default is 0.

- **`timeframe_bars_back`** (series int) Optional. The bar offset on the timeframe specified by the timeframe parameter. If the value is positive, the function retrieves the timestamp of the bar N bars back relative to the bar on the specified timeframe. If the value is a negative number from -1 to -500, the function retrieves the expected time of a future bar on that timeframe. The default is 0.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Time", overlay=true)
t1 = time_close(timeframe.period, "1200-1300", "America/New_York")
bgcolor(not na(t1) ? color.new(color.blue, 90) : na)
```

### Returns

UNIX time.

### Remarks

UNIX time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

If the function call includes bars_back and timeframe_bars_back arguments, it evaluates the bars_back offset before the timeframe_bars_back offset. For example, consider the call time(timeframe = "1M", bars_back = 15, timeframe_bars_back = 10) on a "1D" chart. This function call references the bar from 15 bars back on the "1D" timeframe, determines the "1M" bar that the bar belongs to, and then retrieves the timestamp from 10 "1M" bars back relative to that "1M" bar.

## time_close

## timeframe.change()

Detects changes in the specified timeframe.

## Syntax
- **`timeframe`** (series string) String formatted according to the User manual's timeframe string specifications.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
// Run this script on an intraday chart.
indicator("New day started", overlay = true)
// Highlights the first bar of the new day.
isNewDay = timeframe.change("1D")
bgcolor(isNewDay ? color.new(color.green, 80) : na)
```

### Returns

Returns true on the first bar of a new timeframe, false otherwise.

## timeframe.from_seconds()2 overloads

Converts a number of seconds into a valid timeframe string.

Syntax & Overloads

## timeframe.from_seconds(seconds) → simple string
- **`seconds`** (simple int) The number of seconds in the timeframe.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("HTF Close", "", true)
int chartTf = timeframe.in_seconds()
string tfTimes5 = timeframe.from_seconds(chartTf * 5)
float htfClose = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, tfTimes5, close)
plot(htfClose)
```

### Returns

A timeframe string compliant with timeframe string specifications.

### Remarks

If no valid timeframe exists for the quantity of seconds supplied, the next higher valid timeframe will be returned. Accordingly, one second or less will return "1S", 2-5 seconds will return "5S", and 604,799 seconds (one second less than 7 days) will return "7D".

If the seconds exactly represent two or more valid timeframes, the one with the larger base unit will be used. Thus 604,800 seconds (7 days) returns "1W", not "7D".

All values above 31,622,400 (366 days) return "12M".

## timeframe.in_seconds()
Converts a timeframe string into seconds.

Syntax & Overloads

## timeframe.in_seconds(timeframe) → simple int
- **`timeframe`** (simple string) Timeframe string in timeframe string specifications format. Optional. The default is timeframe.period.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`timeframe_in_seconds()`"),
// Get a user-selected timeframe.
tfInput = input.timeframe("1D")
// Convert it into an "int" number of seconds.
secondsInTf = timeframe.in_seconds(tfInput)
```

## plot(secondsInTf)

### Returns

The "int" representation of the number of seconds in the timeframe string.

### Remarks

When the timeframe is "1M" or more, calculations use 2628003 as the number of seconds in one month, which represents 30.4167 (365/12) days.

## input.timeframe()
Function timestamp returns UNIX time of specified date and time.

Syntax & Overloads

## timestamp(dateString) → const int

## timestamp(dateString) → series int

timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second) → simple int

timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second) → series int

timestamp(timezone, year, month, day, hour, minute, second) → simple int

timestamp(timezone, year, month, day, hour, minute, second) → series int

## Arguments

- **`dateString`** (const string) A string containing the date and, optionally, the time and time zone. Its format must comply with either the IETF RFC 2822 or ISO 8601 standards ("DD MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss ±hhmm" or "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm", so "20 Feb 2020" or "2020-02-20"). If no time is supplied, "00:00" is used. If no time zone is supplied, GMT+0 will be used. Note that this diverges from the usual behavior of the function where it returns time in the exchange's timezone.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("timestamp")
plot(timestamp(2016, 01, 19, 09, 30), linewidth=3, color=color.green)
plot(timestamp(syminfo.timezone, 2016, 01, 19, 09, 30), color=color.blue)
plot(timestamp(2016, 01, 19, 09, 30), color=color.yellow)
plot(timestamp("GMT+6", 2016, 01, 19, 09, 30))
plot(timestamp(2019, 06, 19, 09, 30, 15), color=color.lime)
plot(timestamp("GMT+3", 2019, 06, 19, 09, 30, 15), color=color.fuchsia)
plot(timestamp("Feb 01 2020 22:10:05"))
plot(timestamp("2011-10-10T14:48:00"))
plot(timestamp("04 Dec 1995 00:12:00 GMT+5"))
```

### Returns

UNIX time.

### Remarks

UNIX time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

- **`timezone`** (series string) Optional. Specifies the time zone of the returned week number. The value can be a time zone string in UTC/GMT offset notation (e.g., "UTC-5") or IANA time zone database notation (e.g., "America/New_York"). The default is syminfo.timezone.

### Returns

The calculated week number, expressed in the specified time zone.

### Remarks

A UNIX timestamp represents the number of milliseconds elapsed since 00:00 UTC on 1970-01-01. The meaning of a UNIX timestamp does not change relative to any time zone.

## weekofyear
- **`time`** (series int) UNIX time in milliseconds.

- **`timezone`** (series string) Allows adjusting the returned value to a time zone specified in either UTC/GMT notation (e.g., "UTC-5", "GMT+0530") or as an IANA time zone database name (e.g., "America/New_York"). Optional. The default is syminfo.timezone.

### Returns

Year (in exchange timezone) for provided UNIX time.

### Remarks

UNIX time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970.

Note that this function returns the year based on the time of the bar's open. For overnight sessions (e.g. EURUSD, where Monday session starts on Sunday, 17:00 UTC-4) this value can be lower by 1 than the year of the trading day.

## year
Logical AND. Applicable to boolean expressions.

## Syntax

expr1 and expr2

### Returns

Boolean value, or series of boolean values.

### Remarks

If expr1 evaluates to false, the and operator returns false without evaluating expr2.

## enum

This keyword allows the creation of an enumeration, enum for short. Enums are unique constructs that hold groups of predefined constants.

Each field in an enum has a const string title. Scripts can access the fields in an enum using dot notation, similar to accessing the fields of a user-defined type.

Each field represents a value of the enumName enum. Scripts can declare each field in an enum with an optional const string title. If a field's title is not specified, its title is the string representation of its name. Use str.tostring() on an enum field to retrieve its title.

## Syntax

[export ]enum <enumName>

<field_1> [= <title_1>]

<field_2> [= <title_2>]

...

<field_N> [= <title_N>]

One can use an enum to quickly create a dropdown input with the help of the input.enum() function. The options that appear in the dropdown represent the titles of the enum fields.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Session highlight", overlay = true)
//@enum       Contains fields with popular timezones as titles.
//@field exch Has an empty string as the title to represent the chart timezone.
enum tz
    utc  = "UTC"
    exch = ""
    ny   = "America/New_York"
    chi  = "America/Chicago"
    lon  = "Europe/London"
    tok  = "Asia/Tokyo"
//@variable The session string.
selectedSession = input.session("1200-1500", "Session")
//@variable The selected timezone. The input's dropdown contains the fields in the `tz` enum.
selectedTimezone = input.enum(tz.utc, "Session Timezone")
//@variable Is `true` if the current bar's time is in the specified session.
bool inSession = false
if not na(time("", selectedSession, str.tostring(selectedTimezone)))
    inSession := true
// Highlight the background when `inSession` is `true`.
bgcolor(inSession ? color.new(color.green, 90) : na, title = "Active session highlight")
Additionally, one can use an enum in a collection's type template to restrict the values it will allow as elements. When used inside a type template, the collection will only accept fields that belong to the specified enum.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Map with enum keys")
//@enum        Contains fields with titles representing ticker IDs.
//@field aapl  Has an Apple ticker ID as its title.
//@field tsla  Has a Tesla ticker ID as its title.
//@field amzn  Has an Amazon ticker ID as its title.
enum symbols
    aapl = "NASDAQ:AAPL"
    tsla = "NASDAQ:TSLA"
    amzn = "NASDAQ:AMZN"
//@variable A map that accepts fields from the `symbols` enum as keys and "float" values.
map<symbols, float> data = map.new<symbols, float>()
// Put key-value pairs into the `data` map.
data.put(symbols.aapl, request.security(str.tostring(symbols.aapl), timeframe.period, close))
data.put(symbols.tsla, request.security(str.tostring(symbols.tsla), timeframe.period, close))
data.put(symbols.amzn, request.security(str.tostring(symbols.amzn), timeframe.period, close))
// Plot the value from the `data` map accessed by the `symbols.aapl` key.
plot(data.get(symbols.aapl))
export
Used in libraries to prefix the declaration of functions or user-defined type definitions that will be available from other scripts importing the library.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
//@description Library of debugging functions.
library("Debugging_library", overlay = true)
//@function Displays a string as a table cell for debugging purposes.
//@param txt String to display.
//@returns Void.
export print(string txt) =>
    var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1)
    table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, bgcolor = color.yellow)
// Using the function from inside the library to show an example on the published chart.
// This has no impact on scripts using the library.
print("Library Test")
```

### Remarks

Each library must have at least one exported function or user-defined type (UDT).

Exported functions cannot use variables from the global scope if they are arrays, mutable variables (reassigned with :=), or variables of 'input' form.

Exported functions cannot use request.*() functions.

Exported functions must explicitly declare each parameter's type and all parameters must be used in the function's body. By default, all arguments passed to exported functions are of the series form, unless they are explicitly specified as simple in the function's signature.

The @description, @function, @param, @type, @field, and @returns compiler annotations are used to automatically generate the library's description and release notes, and in the Pine Script® Editor's tooltips.

## library()
Creates a count-controlled loop, which uses a counter variable to manage the iterative executions of its local code block. The loop continues new iterations until the counter reaches a specified final value.

## Syntax

[variables =|:=] for counter = from_num to to_num [by step_num]

    statements | continue | break

##     return_expression

- **`variables`** (return_expression type) Optional. A variable or tuple to hold the values or references from the last evaluation of return_expression after the loop terminates. The script can assign the loop's returned results to variables only if the results are not of the "void" type. If the loop's conditions prevent iteration, or if no iterations evaluate return_expression, the variables' assigned values or references are na, or false if the return type is "bool".

- **`counter`** (series int/float) The counter variable. The loop increments the variable's value from the initial value (from_num) to the final value (to_num) by a fixed amount (step_num) after each iteration. The last possible iteration occurs when the variable's value reaches the to_num value.

- **`from_num`** (series int/float) The value of the counter variable on the loop's first iteration.

- **`to_num`** (series int/float) The final counter value for which the loop's header allows a new iteration. The loop increments the counter value by the step_num until it reaches or passes this value. If the script modifies this value during a loop iteration, the loop header uses the new value to control the allowed subsequent iterations.

- **`step_num`** (series int/float) Optional. A positive value specifying the amount by which the counter value increases or decreases until it reaches or passes the to_num value. If the from_num value is greater than the initial to_num value, the loop subtracts this amount from the counter value after each iteration. Otherwise, the loop adds this amount after each iteration. The default is 1.

statements The code statements and expressions within the loop's body, i.e., the indented block of code beneath the loop header.

return_expression (any type) The last expression or statement within the loop's body. The loop returns the results from this code after the final iteration. If the loop stops prematurely due to a continue or break statement, the returned values or references are those of the latest iteration that evaluated this code. To use the loop's returned results, assign them to a variable or tuple.

continue A loop-specific keyword that instructs the script to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and continue to the next iteration.

break A loop-specific keyword that prompts the script to stop the current iteration and exit the loop entirely.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Basic `for` loop")
//@function Calculates the number of bars in the last `length` bars that have their `close` above the current `close`.
//@param length The number of bars used in the calculation.
greaterCloseCount(length) =>
    int result = 0
    for i = 1 to length
        if close[i] > close
            result += 1
    result
```

## plot(greaterCloseCount(14))

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`for` loop with a step")
a = array.from(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
sum = 0.0
for i = 0 to 9 by 5
    // Because the step is set to 5, we are adding only the first (0) and the sixth (5) value from the array `a`.
    sum += array.get(a, i)
```

## plot(sum)

### Remarks

Modifying a loop's to_num value during an iteration does not change the direction of the loop's counter. For a loop that counts upward, setting the to_num to a value less than the from_num value on an iteration stops the loop immediately after that iteration ends. Likewise, a loop that counts downward stops after an iteration where the to_num value becomes greater than the from_num value.

If a script initializes a variable declared with var or varip using a loop's result, the loop stops after the first iteration, even if the header's criteria allow more iterations. Instead of initializing the variable with the result of this structure directly, declare the variable first and use := to update it with the result. Alternatively, move the loop into a Declaring functions and initialize the variable using a call to that function.

See the Loops page of our User Manual to learn more about loops and how they work.

## for...in
Creates a collection-controlled loop, which iterates over the elements of an array, the rows of a matrix, or the key-value pairs of a map in order. The loop's local code block executes once for each element, row, or pair in the specified collection.

## Syntax

[variables = | :=] for item in collection_id

    statements | continue | break

##     return_expression

[variables = | :=] for [index, item] in collection_id

    statements | continue | break

##     return_expression

- **`variables`** (return_expression type) - Optional. A variable or tuple to hold the values or references from the last evaluation of return_expression after the loop terminates. The script can assign the loop's returned results to variables only if the results are not of the "void" type. If the loop's conditions prevent iteration, or if no iterations evaluate return_expression, the variables' assigned values or references are na, or false if the return type is "bool".

index - A variable to track the array element index, matrix row index, or map key of the current iteration. The loop cannot modify this variable using reassignment or compound assignment operators. This variable is valid only in the second form of the loop structure.

item - A variable to track the array element, matrix row, or map value element of the current iteration. The loop cannot modify this variable using reassignment or compound assignment operators.

collection_id (array/matrix/map) - The ID of the array, matrix, or map whose items the loop iterates over.

statements - The code statements and expressions within the loop's body, i.e., the indented block of code beneath the loop header.

return_expression (any type) - The last expression or statement within the loop's body. The loop returns the results from this code after the final iteration. If the loop stops prematurely due to a continue or break statement, the returned values or references are those of the latest iteration that evaluated this code. To use the loop's returned results, assign them to a variable or tuple.

continue - A loop-specific keyword that instructs the script to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and continue to the next iteration.

break - A loop-specific keyword that prompts the script to stop the current iteration and exit the loop entirely.

The following example uses the first form of the for...in loop to count the number of array element values that are greater than a specified value:

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("'for...in' array (first form) demo")
//@function Counts the number of 'id' array elements that are greater than the specified value.
numGreaterThan(array<float> id, float value) =>
    int result = 0
    for element in id
        if element > value
            result += 1
    result
//@variable References an array containing the current bar's OHLC values.
array<float> ohlcValues = array.from(open, high, low, close)
// Plot the number of 'ohlcValues' elements that are greater than the 20-bar SMA of 'close'.
plot(numGreaterThan(ohlcValues, ta.sma(close, 20)))
The example below uses the second form of the loop structure to perform element-wise addition between two arrays:
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`for...in` array (second form) demo")
//@function Creates a new array whose elements are the sums of corresponding elements in the `id1` and `id2` arrays.
elementWiseAdd(array<float> id1, array<float> id2) =>
    array<float> result = array.new<float>()
    // Loop through the `id1` array while tracking each element's index *and* value.
    for [index, element1] in id1
        // Use `index` to retrieve the corresponding element in the `id2` array, then push the sum into the new array.
        float element2 = id2.get(index)
        result.push(element1 + element2)
    result
```

## if barstate.isfirst

    // Create two arrays for which to perform element-wise addition.

    array<float> array1 = array.from(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

    array<float> array2 = array.from(2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0)

    //@variable References the resulting array of element-wise sums.

##     array<float> sums = elementWiseAdd(array1, array2)

    // Log a string representation of the `sums` array's contents in the Pine Logs pane.

##     log.info(str.tostring(sums))

This example uses the first form of the loop structure to iterate over the rows of a matrix and create an array containing each one's sum. The header's loop variable, rowArrayID, references an array containing the current row's values:

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`for...in` matrix (first form) demo")
//@function Creates a matrix that organizes the contents of the `arrayID` array into a specified shape.
matrixFromArray(array<float> arrayID, int rows, int columns) =>
    matrix<float> result = matrix.new<float>()
    result.add_row(0, arrayID)
    result.reshape(rows, columns)
    result
//@function Creates an array containing the sum of elements in each row of the `matrixID` matrix.
calcRowSums(matrix<float> matrixID) =>
    array<float> result = array.new<float>()
    // Iterate over the matrix rows, where `rowArrayID` references an *array* containing the current row's values.
    for rowArrayID in matrixID
        // Push the sum of `rowArrayID` elements into the `result` array.
        result.push(rowArrayID.sum())
    result
```

## if barstate.isfirst

    // Create a 2x2 matrix of pseudorandom values.

    array<float>  randArray = array.from(math.random(), math.random(), math.random(), math.random())

    matrix<float> randMat   = matrixFromArray(randArray, 2, 2)

    // Log string representation of the `randMat` matrix and the calculated array of row sums in the Pine Logs pane.

##     log.info("\n" + str.tostring(randMat))

##     log.info(str.tostring(calcRowSums(randMat)))

The following example uses a for...in loop to iterate over a map's key-value pairs and construct a custom string representation of its contents:

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`for...in` map demo")
//@function Creates a custom string representation of a map containing "string" keys and "float" values.
toString(map<string, float> id) =>
    string result = "{"
    // Iterate through the key-value pairs of the `id` map, in insertion order.
    for [key, value] in id
        result += str.format("''{0}'': {1}, ", key, value)
    result += "}"
    result := str.replace(result, ", }", "}")
```

## if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory

    //@variable References a map to store "float" OHLC values with corresponding "string" keys.

    map<string, float> ohlcMap = map.new<string, float>()

    // Put key-value pairs into the map.

##     ohlcMap.put("Open",  open)
    // Log the `toString()` result for the map referenced by `ohlcMap`.

##     log.info(toString(ohlcMap))

### Remarks

Only the second form of the for...in loop is compatible with maps. The loop iterates over the key-value pairs of a map in the insertion order of its keys.

Scripts can modify the sizes of arrays and matrices while iterating over their contents with a for...in loop. However, they cannot modify the sizes of maps while looping over them directly with this structure. To modify a map while using a for...in loop, use the loop on a copy of the map or on the map's map.keys() array.

If a script initializes a variable declared with var or varip using a loop's result, the loop stops after the first iteration, even if the header's criteria allow more iterations. Instead of initializing the variable with the result of this structure directly, declare the variable first and use := to update it with the result. Alternatively, move the loop into a Declaring functions and initialize the variable using a call to that function.

See the Loops page of our User Manual to learn more about loops and how they work.

## for
If statement defines what block of statements must be executed when conditions of the expression are satisfied.

To have access to and use the if statement, one should specify the version >= 2 of Pine Script® language in the very first line of code, for example: //@version=6

The 4th version of Pine Script® Language allows you to use “else if” syntax.

General code form:

## Syntax

var_declarationX = if condition

##     var_decl_then0
else if [optional block]

##     var_decl_else0
var_declarationX — this variable gets the value of the if statement

condition — if the condition is true, the logic from the block 'then' (var_decl_then0, var_decl_then1, etc.) is used.

If the condition is false, the logic from the block 'else' (var_decl_else0, var_decl_else1, etc.) is used.

return_expression_then, return_expression_else — the last expression from the block then or from the block else will return the final value of the statement. If declaration of the variable is in the end, its value will be the result.

- **`The type of returning value of the if statement depends on return_expression_then and return_expression_else type`** (their types must match: it is not possible to return an integer value from then, while you have a string value in else block).

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("if")
// This code compiles
x = if close > open
    close
else
    open
// This code doesn’t compile
// y = if close > open
//     close
// else
//     "open"
plot(x)
It is possible to omit the else block. In this case if the condition is false, an “empty” value (na, false, or “”) will be assigned to the var_declarationX variable:
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("if")
x = if close > open
    close
// If current close > current open, then x = close.
// Otherwise the x = na.
plot(x)
It is possible to use either multiple “else if” blocks or none at all. The blocks “then”, “else if”, “else” are shifted by four spaces:
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("if")
x = if open > close
    5
else if high > low
    close
else
    open
plot(x)
It is possible to ignore the resulting value of an if statement (“var_declarationX=“ can be omitted). It may be useful if you need the side effect of the expression, for example in strategy trading:
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("if")
if (ta.crossover(high, low))
    strategy.entry("BBandLE", strategy.long, stop=low, oca_name="BollingerBands", oca_type=strategy.oca.cancel, comment="BBandLE")
else
    strategy.cancel(id="BBandLE")
If statements can include each other:
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("if")
float x = na
if close > open
    if close > close[1]
        x := close
    else
        x := close[1]
else
    x := open
plot(x)
import
Used to load an external library() into a script and bind its functions to a namespace. The importing script can be an indicator, a strategy, or another library. A library must be published (privately or publicly) before it can be imported.
Syntax
import {username}/{libraryName}/{libraryVersion} as {alias}
Arguments
username (literal string) User name of the library's author.
libraryName (literal string) Name of the imported library, which corresponds to the title argument used by the author in his library script.
libraryVersion (literal int) Version number of the imported library.
alias (literal string) A non-numeric identifier used as a namespace to refer to the library's functions. Optional. The default is the libraryName string.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("num_methods import")
// Import the first version of the username’s "num_methods" library and assign it to the "m" namespace",
import username/num_methods/1 as m
// Call the “sinh()” function from the imported library
y = m.sinh(3.14)
// Plot value returned by the "sinh()" function",
plot(y)
```

### Remarks

Using an alias that replaces a built-in namespace such as math.* or strategy.* is allowed, but if the library contains function names that shadow Pine Script®'s built-in functions, the built-ins will become unavailable. The same version of a library can only be imported once. Aliases must be distinct for each imported library. When calling library functions, casting their arguments to types other than their declared type is not allowed. An import statement cannot use 'as' or 'import' as username, libraryName, or alias identifiers.

## library()
This keyword is used to prefix a function declaration, indicating it can then be invoked using dot notation by appending its name to a variable of the type of its first parameter and omitting that first parameter. Alternatively, functions declared as methods can also be invoked like normal user-defined functions. In that case, an argument must be supplied for its first parameter.

The first parameter of a method declaration must be explicitly typified.

## Syntax

[export] method <functionName>(<paramType> <paramName> [= <defaultValue>], …) =>

##     <functionBlock>

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("")
```

## var prices = array.new<float>()

//@function Pushes a new value into the array and removes the first one if the resulting array is greater than `maxSize`. Can be used as a method.

method maintainArray(array<float> id, maxSize, value) =>

##     id.push(value)
// The method can also be called like a function, without using dot notation.

// In this case an argument must be supplied for its first parameter.

// maintainArray(prices, 50, close)

// This calls the `array.avg()` built-in using dot notation with the `prices` array.

// It is possible because built-in functions belonging to some namespaces that are a special Pine type

// can be invoked with method notation when the function's first parameter is an ID of that type.

// Those namespaces are: `array`, `matrix`, `line`, `linefill`, `label`, `box`, and `table`.

## plot(prices.avg())

## not

- **`Logical negation`** (NOT). Applicable to boolean expressions.

## Syntax

not expr1

### Returns

Boolean value, or series of boolean values.

## or

Logical OR. Applicable to boolean expressions.

## Syntax

expr1 or expr2

### Returns

Boolean value, or series of boolean values.

### Remarks

If expr1 evaluates to true, the or operator returns true without evaluating expr2.

## switch

The switch operator transfers control to one of the several statements, depending on the values of a condition and expressions.

## Syntax

[variable_declaration = ] switch expression

    value1 => local_block

    value2 => local_block

##     …

    => default_local_block

[variable_declaration = ] switch

    condition1 => local_block

    condition2 => local_block

##     …

    => default_local_block

Switch with an expression:

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Switch using an expression")
string i_maType = input.string("EMA", "MA type", options = ["EMA", "SMA", "RMA", "WMA"])
float ma = switch i_maType
    "EMA" => ta.ema(close, 10)
    "SMA" => ta.sma(close, 10)
    "RMA" => ta.rma(close, 10)
    // Default used when the three first cases do not match.
    => ta.wma(close, 10)
```

## plot(ma)

Switch without an expression:

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("Switch without an expression", overlay = true)
bool longCondition  = ta.crossover( ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
bool shortCondition = ta.crossunder(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
```

## switch
### Returns

The value of the last expression in the local block of statements that is executed.

### Remarks

Only one of the local_block instances or the default_local_block can be executed. The default_local_block is introduced with the => token alone and is only executed when none of the preceding blocks are executed. If the result of the switch statement is assigned to a variable and a default_local_block is not specified, the statement returns na if no local_block is executed. When assigning the result of the switch statement to a variable, all local_block instances must return the same type of value.

## if
This keyword allows the declaration of user-defined types (UDT) from which scripts can instantiate objects. UDTs are composite types that contain an arbitrary number of fields of any built-in or user-defined type, including the defined UDT itself. The syntax to define a UDT is:

## Syntax

[export ]type <UDT_identifier>

    [varip ]<field_type> <field_name> [= <value>]

##     …

Once a UDT is defined, scripts can instantiate objects from it with the UDT_identifier.new() construct. When creating a new type instance, the fields of the resulting object will initialize with the default values from the UDT's definition. Any type fields without specified defaults will initialize as na. Alternatively, users can pass initial values as arguments in the *.new() method to override the type's defaults. For example, newFooObject = foo.new(x = true) assigns a new foo object to the newFooObject variable with its x field initialized using a value of true.

Field declarations can include the varip keyword, in which case the field values persist between successive script iterations on the same bar.

For more information see the User Manual's sections on defining UDTs and using objects.

Libraries can export UDTs. See the Libraries page of our User Manual to learn more.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Multi Time Period Chart", overlay = true)
```

## timeframeInput = input.timeframe("1D")

type bar

    float o = open

    float h = high

    float l = low

    float c = close

    int   t = time

## drawBox(bar b, right) =>

    color boxColor = b.c >= b.o ? color.green : color.red

    box.new(b.t, b.h, right, b.l, boxColor, xloc = xloc.bar_time, bgcolor = color.new(boxColor, 90))

## updateBox(box boxId, bar b) =>

    color boxColor = b.c >= b.o ? color.green : color.red

##     box.set_border_color(boxId, boxColor)
    // To avoid a runtime error, only process data when an object exists.

##     if not barstate.islast

##         if timeframe.change(timeframeInput)

            // On historical bars, draw a new box in the past when the HTF closes.

##             drawBox(secBar, time[1])

##     else

        var box lastBox = na

##         if na(lastBox) or timeframe.change(timeframeInput)

            // On the last bar, only draw a new current box the first time we get there or when HTF changes.

##             lastBox := drawBox(secBar, time)

##         else

            // On other chart updates, use setters to modify the current box.

##             updateBox(lastBox, secBar)

## var

var is the keyword used for assigning and one-time initializing of the variable.

Normally, a syntax of assignment of variables, which doesn’t include the keyword var, results in the value of the variable being overwritten with every update of the data. Contrary to that, when assigning variables with the keyword var, they can “keep the state” despite the data updating, only changing it when conditions within if-expressions are met.

## Syntax

var variable_name = expression

## where:

variable_name - any name of the user’s variable that’s allowed in Pine Script® (can contain capital and lowercase Latin characters, numbers, and underscores (_), but can’t start with a number).

expression - any arithmetic expression, just as with defining a regular variable. The expression will be calculated and assigned to a variable once.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Var keyword example")
var a = close
var b = 0.0
var c = 0.0
var green_bars_count = 0
if close > open
    var x = close
    b := x
    green_bars_count := green_bars_count + 1
    if green_bars_count >= 10
        var y = close
        c := y
plot(a)
plot(b)
plot(c)
The variable 'a' keeps the closing price of the first bar for each bar in the series.
The variable 'b' keeps the closing price of the first "green" bar in the series.
The variable 'c' keeps the closing price of the tenth "green" bar in the series.
varip
varip (var intrabar persist) is the keyword used for the assignment and one-time initialization of a variable or a field of a user-defined type. It’s similar to the var keyword, but variables and fields declared with varip retain their values between executions of the script on the same bar.
Syntax
varip [<variable_type> ]<variable_name> = <expression>
[export ]type <UDT_identifier>
    varip <field_type> <field_name> [= <value>]
where:
variable_type - An optional fundamental type (int, float, bool, color, string) or a user-defined type, or an array or matrix of one of those types. Special types are not compatible with this keyword.
variable_name - A valid identifier. The variable can also be an object created from a UDT.
expression - Any arithmetic expression, just as when defining a regular variable. The expression will be calculated and assigned to the variable only once, on the first bar.
UDT_identifier, field_type, field_name, value - Constructs related to user-defined types as described in the type section.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("varip")
varip int v = -1
v := v + 1
plot(v)
With var, v would equal the value of the bar_index. On historical bars, where the script calculates only once per chart bar, the value of v is the same as with var. However, on realtime bars, the script will evaluate the expression on each new chart update, producing a different result.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("varip with types")
type barData
    int index = -1
    varip int ticks = -1
```

## var currBar = barData.new()
// Will be equal to bar_index on all bars

## plot(currBar.index)

// In real time, will increment per every tick on the chart

## plot(currBar.ticks)

The same += operation applied to both the index and ticks fields results in different real-time values because ticks increases on every chart update, while index only does so once per bar. Note how the currBar object does not use the varip keyword. The ticks field of the object can increment on every tick, but the reference itself is defined once and then stays unchanged. If we were to declare currBar using varip, the behavior of index would remain unchanged because while the reference to the type instance would persist between chart updates, the index field of the object would not.

### Remarks

When using varip to declare variables in strategies that may execute more than once per historical chart bar, the values of such variables are preserved across successive iterations of the script on the same bar.

The effect of varip eliminates the rollback of variables before each successive execution of a script on the same bar.

## while

Creates a condition-controlled loop whose local code block executes repeatedly while the value of a conditional expression remains true. The loop's iterations end after the condition's value becomes false.

## Syntax

[variables = | :=] while condition

    statements | continue | break

##     return_expression

- **`variables`** (return_expression type) - Optional. A variable or tuple to hold the values or references from the last evaluation of return_expression after the loop terminates. The script can assign the loop's returned results to variables only if the results are not of the "void" type. If the loop's conditions prevent iteration, or if no iterations evaluate return_expression, the variables' assigned values or references are na, or false if the return type is "bool".

- **`condition`** (series bool) - The conditional expression that controls the loop's iterations. If true, the script performs a new iteration. If false, the script exits the loop without performing a new iteration.

statements - The code statements and expressions within the loop's body, i.e., the indented block of code beneath the loop header.

return_expression (any type) - The last expression or statement within the loop's body. The loop returns the results from this code after the final iteration. If the loop stops prematurely due to a continue or break statement, the returned values or references are those of the latest iteration that evaluated this code. To use the loop's returned results, assign them to a variable or tuple.

continue - A loop-specific keyword that instructs the script to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and continue to the next iteration.

break - A loop-specific keyword that prompts the script to stop the current iteration and exit the loop entirely.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("`while` demo")
//@variable The number for which to calculate the factorial (N!).
//          The factorial is the product of all integers from 1 to `n`, with the exception (0! == 1).
int n = input.int(10, "N", 0)
//@variable The current value to multiply in the factorial calculation.
var int counter = n
//@variable The factorial value.
var int factorial = 1
```

    // Repeatedly multiply `factorial` by `counter` and decrease the `counter` value by 1.

    // The loop ends after the value of `counter` becomes 0.

    while counter > 0

        factorial *= counter

        counter   -= 1

## plot(factorial, "N!")

### Remarks

If a script initializes a variable declared with var or varip using a loop's result, the loop stops after the first iteration, even if the header's criteria allow more iterations. Instead of initializing the variable with the result of this structure directly, declare the variable first and use := to update it with the result. Alternatively, move the loop into a Declaring functions and initialize the variable using a call to that function.

See the Loops page of our User Manual to learn more about loops and how they work.

Types

## array

Keyword used to explicitly declare the "array" type of a variable or a parameter. Array objects (or IDs) can be created with the array.new<type>(), array.from() function.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("array", overlay=true)
array<float> a = na
a := array.new<float>(1, close)
plot(array.get(a, 0))
```

### Remarks

Array objects are always of "series" form.

## var
- **`Keyword used to explicitly declare the "bool"`** (boolean) type of a variable or a parameter. "Bool" variables can have values true or false.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("bool")
bool b = true    // Same as `b = true`
plot(b ? open : close)
```

### Remarks

Explicitly mentioning the type in a variable declaration is optional. Learn more about Pine Script® types in the User Manual page on the Type System.

## var
Keyword used to explicitly declare the "box" type of a variable or a parameter. Box objects (or IDs) can be created with the box.new() function.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("box")
// Empty `box1` box ID.
var box box1 = na
// `box` type is unnecessary because `box.new()` returns a "box" type.
var box2 = box.new(na, na, na, na)
box3 = box.new(time, open, time + 60 * 60 * 24, close, xloc=xloc.bar_time)
```

### Remarks

Box objects are always of "series" form.

## var
Keyword to explicitly declare the type of a variable or parameter as chart.point. Scripts can produce chart.point instances using the chart.point.from_time(), chart.point.from_index(), chart.point.now(), and chart.point.new() functions.

## Fields

- **`index`** (series int) The x-coordinate of the point, expressed as a bar index value.

- **`time`** (series int) The x-coordinate of the point, expressed as a UNIX time value, in milliseconds.

- **`price`** (series float) The y-coordinate of the point.

## polyline

## color

Keyword used to explicitly declare the "color" type of a variable or a parameter.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("color", overlay = true)
```

## color textColor = color.green

color labelColor = #FF000080 // Red color (FF0000) with 50% transparency (80 which is half of FF).

## if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory

    label.new(bar_index, high, text = "Label", color = labelColor, textcolor = textColor)

- **`// When declaring variables with color literals, built-in constants(color.green) or functions`** (color.new(), color.rgb()), the "color" keyword for the type can be omitted.

## c = color.rgb(0,255,0,0)

## plot(close, color = c)

### Remarks

Color literals have the following format: #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA. The letter pairs represent 00 to FF hexadecimal values (0 to 255 in decimal) where RR, GG and BB pairs are the values for the color's red, green and blue components. AA is an optional value for the color's transparency (or alpha component) where 00 is invisible and FF opaque. When no AA pair is supplied, FF is used. The hexadecimal letters can be upper or lower case.

Explicitly mentioning the type in a variable declaration is optional, except when it is initialized with na. Learn more about Pine Script® types in the User Manual page on the Type System.

## var
The const keyword explicitly assigns the "const" type qualifier to variables and the parameters of non-exported functions. Variables and parameters with the "const" qualifier reference values established at compile time that never change in the script's execution.

In variable declarations, the compiler can usually infer the qualified type automatically based on the values assigned to a variable, and it can automatically change a variable's qualifier to a stronger one when necessary. The type qualifier hierarchy is "const" < "input" < "simple" < "series", where "const" is the weakest.

- **`Explicitly declaring a variable with the const keyword restricts the type qualifier to "const", meaning the variable cannot accept a value with a stronger qualifier`** (e.g., "input"), nor can the value assigned to the variable change at any point in the script's execution.

When using this keyword to specify the type qualifier, one must also use a type keyword to declare the allowed type.

## Syntax

[method ]<functionName>([const <paramType> ]<paramName>[ = <defaultValue>])

[var/varip ]const <variableType> <variableName> = <variableValue>

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("custom plot title")
//@function Concatenates two "const string" values.
concatStrings(const string x, const string y) =>
    const string result = x + y
//@variable The title of the plot.
const string myTitle = concatStrings("My ", "Plot")
```

## plot(close, myTitle)

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("can't assign input to const")
//@variable A variable declared as "const float" that attempts to assign the result of `input.float()` as its value.
//          This declaration causes an error. The "input float" qualified type is stronger than "const float".
const float myVar = input.float(2.0)
```

## plot(myVar)

### Remarks

To learn more, see our User Manual's section on type qualifiers.

## simple
- **`Keyword used to explicitly declare the "float"`** (floating point) type of a variable or a parameter.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("float")
float f = 3.14    // Same as `f = 3.14`
f := na
plot(f)
```

### Remarks

Explicitly mentioning the type in a variable declaration is optional, except when it is initialized with na. Learn more about Pine Script® types in the User Manual page on the Type System.

## var
- **`Keyword used to explicitly declare the "int"`** (integer) type of a variable or a parameter.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("int")
int i = 14    // Same as `i = 14`
i := na
plot(i)
```

### Remarks

Explicitly mentioning the type in a variable declaration is optional, except when it is initialized with na. Learn more about Pine Script® types in the User Manual page on the Type System.

## var
Keyword used to explicitly declare the "label" type of a variable or a parameter. Label objects (or IDs) can be created with the label.new() function.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("label")
// Empty `label1` label ID.
var label label1 = na
// `label` type is unnecessary because `label.new()` returns "label" type.
var label2 = label.new(na, na, na)
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    label3 = label.new(bar_index, high, text = "label3 text")
```

### Remarks

Label objects are always of "series" form.

## var
Keyword used to explicitly declare the "line" type of a variable or a parameter. Line objects (or IDs) can be created with the line.new() function.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("line")
// Empty `line1` line ID.
var line line1 = na
// `line` type is unnecessary because `line.new()` returns "line" type.
var line2 = line.new(na, na, na, na)
line3 = line.new(bar_index - 1, high, bar_index, high, extend = extend.right)
```

### Remarks

Line objects are always of "series" form.

## var
Keyword used to explicitly declare the "linefill" type of a variable or a parameter. Linefill objects (or IDs) can be created with the linefill.new() function.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("linefill", overlay=true)
// Empty `linefill1` line ID.
var linefill linefill1 = na
// `linefill` type is unnecessary because `linefill.new()` returns "linefill" type.
var linefill2 = linefill.new(na, na, na)
```

## if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory

    line1 = line.new(bar_index - 10, high+1, bar_index, high+1, extend = extend.right)

    line2 = line.new(bar_index - 10, low+1, bar_index, low+1, extend = extend.right)

    linefill3 = linefill.new(line1, line2, color = color.new(color.green, 80))

### Remarks

Linefill objects are always of "series" form.

## var
Keyword used to explicitly declare the "map" type of a variable or a parameter. Map objects (or IDs) can be created with the map.new<type,type>() function.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("map", overlay=true)
map<int, float> a = na
a := map.new<int, float>()
a.put(bar_index, close)
label.new(bar_index, a.get(bar_index), "Current close")
```

### Remarks

Map objects are always of series form.

## map.new<type,type>()

## matrix

Keyword used to explicitly declare the "matrix" type of a variable or a parameter. Matrix objects (or IDs) can be created with the matrix.new<type>() function.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("matrix example")
// Create `m1` matrix of `int` type.
matrix<int> m1 = matrix.new<int>(2, 3, 0)
// `matrix<int>` is unnecessary because the `matrix.new<int>()` function returns an `int` type matrix object.
m2 = matrix.new<int>(2, 3, 0)
// Display matrix using a label.
if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory
    label.new(bar_index, high, str.tostring(m2))
```

### Remarks

Matrix objects are always of "series" form.

## var
Keyword to explicitly declare the type of a variable or parameter as polyline. Scripts can produce polyline instances using the polyline.new() function.

## chart.point

## series

The series keyword explicitly assigns the "series" type qualifier to variables and function parameters. Variables and parameters that use the "series" qualifier can reference values that change throughout a script's execution.

Explicit use of the series keyword when declaring the parameters of a library's exported functions is typically unnecessary, as the compiler can usually automatically detect whether a parameter is compatible with "series" or "simple" qualified values. By default, all exported function parameters are qualified as "series" wherever possible.

In variable declarations, the compiler can usually infer the qualified type automatically based on the values assigned to a variable, and it can automatically change a variable's qualifier to a stronger one when necessary. The type qualifier hierarchy is "const" < "input" < "simple" < "series", where "series" is the strongest.

- **`Explicitly declaring a variable with the series keyword restricts the type qualifier to "series", meaning the script cannot pass its value to any variable or function parameter that requires a value with a weaker qualifier`** ("const", "input", or "simple").

When using this keyword to specify the type qualifier, one must also use a type keyword to declare the allowed type.

## Syntax

export [method ]<functionName>([[series ]<paramType>] <paramName>[ = <defaultValue>])

[method ]<functionName>([series <paramType> ]<paramName>[ = <defaultValue>])

[var/varip ]series <variableType> <variableName> = <variableValue>

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
//@description A library with custom functions.
library("CustomFunctions", overlay = true)
//@function Finds the highest `source` value over `length` bars, filtered by the `cond` condition.
export conditionalHighest(series float source, series bool cond, series int length) =>
    //@variable The highest `source` value from when the `cond` was `true` over `length` bars.
    series float result = na
    // Loop to find the highest value.
    for i = 0 to length - 1
        if cond[i]
            value   = source[i]
            result := math.max(nz(result, value), value)
    // Return the `result`.
    result
//@variable Is `true` once every five bars.
series bool condition = bar_index % 5 == 0
//@variable The highest `close` value from every fifth bar over the last 100 bars.
series float hiValue = conditionalHighest(close, condition, 100)
```

## plot(hiValue)

bgcolor(condition ? color.new(color.teal, 80) : na)

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("series variable not allowed")
//@variable A variable declared as "series int" with a value of 5.
series int myVar = 5
// This call causes an error.
// The `histbase` accepts "input int/float". It can't accept the stronger "series int" qualified type.
plot(close, style = plot.style_histogram, histbase = myVar)
```

### Remarks

To learn more, see our User Manual's section on type qualifiers.

## simple
The simple keyword explicitly assigns the "simple" type qualifier to variables and function parameters. Variables and parameters that use the "simple" qualifier can reference values established at the beginning of a script's execution that do not change later.

To restrict the parameters in a library's exported functions to only allow values with a "simple" or weaker type qualifier, using the simple keyword when declaring parameters is often necessary, as libraries automatically qualify all parameters as "series" wherever possible by default. Explicitly restricting functions to accept "simple" arguments also allows them to return "simple" values in some cases, depending on the operations they execute, making them usable with the parameters of built-in functions that do not allow "series" arguments.

In variable declarations, the compiler can usually infer the qualified type automatically based on the values assigned to a variable, and it can automatically change a variable's qualifier to a stronger one when necessary. The type qualifier hierarchy is "const" < "input" < "simple" < "series", where "simple" is stronger than "input" and "const".

- **`Explicitly declaring a variable with the simple keyword restricts the type qualifier to "simple", meaning the script cannot pass its value to any variable or function parameter that requires a value with a weaker qualifier`** ("const" or "input"). Additionally, one cannot assign a "series" value to a variable explicitly declared with the simple keyword.

When using this keyword to specify the type qualifier, one must also use a type keyword to declare the allowed type.

## Syntax

export [method ]<functionName>([[simple ]<paramType>] <paramName>[ = <defaultValue>])

[method ]<functionName>([simple <paramType> ]<paramName>[ = <defaultValue>])

[var/varip ]simple <variableType> <variableName> = <variableValue></variableValue>

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
//@description A library with custom functions.
library("CustomFunctions", overlay = true)
//@function         Calculates the length values for a ribbon of four EMAs by multiplying the `baseLength`.
//@param baseLength The initial EMA length. Requires "simple int" because you can't use "series int" in `ta.ema()`.
//@returns          A tuple of length values.
export ribbonLengths(simple int baseLength) =>
    simple int length1 = baseLength
    simple int length2 = baseLength * 2
    simple int length3 = baseLength * 3
    simple int length4 = baseLength * 4
    [length1, length2, length3, length4]
// Get a tuple of "simple int" length values.
[len1, len2, len3, len4] = ribbonLengths(14)
// Plot four EMAs using the values from the tuple.
plot(ta.ema(close, len1), "EMA 1", color = color.red)
plot(ta.ema(close, len2), "EMA 1", color = color.orange)
plot(ta.ema(close, len3), "EMA 1", color = color.green)
plot(ta.ema(close, len4), "EMA 1", color = color.blue)
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("can't change simple to series")
//@variable A variable declared as "simple float" with a value of 5.0.
simple float myVar = 5.0
// This reassignment causes an error.
// The `close` variable returns a "series float" value. Since `myVar` is restricted to "simple" values, it cannot
// change its qualifier to "series".
myVar := close
```

## plot(myVar)

### Remarks

To learn more, see our User Manual's section on type qualifiers.

## series
Keyword used to explicitly declare the "string" type of a variable or a parameter.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("string")
string s = "Hello World!"    // Same as `s = "Hello world!"`
// string s = na // same as ""
plot(na, title=s)
```

### Remarks

Explicitly mentioning the type in a variable declaration is optional, except when it is initialized with na. Learn more about Pine Script® types in the User Manual page on the Type System.

## var
Keyword used to explicitly declare the "table" type of a variable or a parameter. Table objects (or IDs) can be created with the table.new() function.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("table")
// Empty `table1` table ID.
var table table1 = na
// `table` type is unnecessary because `table.new()` returns "table" type.
var table2 = table.new(position.top_left, na, na)
```

## if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory

    var table3 = table.new(position = position.top_right, columns = 1, rows = 1, bgcolor = color.yellow, border_width = 1)

    table.cell(table_id = table3, column = 0, row = 0, text = "table3 text")

### Remarks

Table objects are always of "series" form.

## var

## Syntax

expr1 - expr2

### Returns

Returns integer or float value, or series of values:

Binary - returns expr1 minus expr2.

Unary - returns the negation of expr.

### Remarks

You may use arithmetic operators with numbers as well as with series variables. In case of usage with series the operators are applied elementwise.

## -=

Subtraction assignment. Applicable to numerical expressions.

## Syntax

expr1 -= expr2

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("-=")
// Equals to expr1 = expr1 - expr2.
a = 2
b = 3
a -= b
// Result: a = -1.
plot(a)
```

### Returns

Integer or float value, or series of values.

## :=

Reassignment operator. It is used to assign a new value to a previously declared variable.

## Syntax

<var_name> := <new_value>

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("My script")
myVar = 10
if close > open
    // Modifies the existing global scope `myVar` variable by changing its value from 10 to 20.
    myVar := 20
    // Creates a new `myVar` variable local to the `if` condition and unreachable from the global scope.
    // Does not affect the `myVar` declared in global scope.
    myVar = 30
```

## plot(myVar)

## !=

Inequality operator. Returns true if the operands are considered not equal, and false otherwise. This operator is compatible with all value types, including "int", "float", "bool", "color", and "string". The operator can also compare two line or label IDs.

## Syntax

expr1 != expr2

### Returns

Boolean value, or series of boolean values.

### Remarks

This operator rounds "float" operands to nine fractional digits.

## ?:

Ternary conditional operator.

## Syntax

//@version=6
indicator("?:")
// Draw circles at the bars where open crosses close
s2 = ta.cross(open, close) ? math.avg(open,close) : na
plot(s2, style=plot.style_circles, linewidth=2, color=color.red)
// Combination of ?: operators for 'switch'-like logic
c = timeframe.isintraday ? color.red : timeframe.isdaily ? color.green : timeframe.isweekly ? color.blue : color.gray
plot(hl2, color=c)
```

### Returns

expr2 if expr1 is evaluated to true, expr3 otherwise. Zero value (0 and also NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) is considered to be false, any other value is true.

### Remarks

Use na for 'else' branch if you do not need it.

You can combine two or more ?: operators to achieve the equivalent of a 'switch'-like statement (see examples above).

You may use arithmetic operators with numbers as well as with series variables. In case of usage with series the operators are applied elementwise.

## na

## []

Series subscript. Provides access to previous values of series expr1. expr2 is the number of bars back, and must be numerical. Floats will be rounded down.

## Syntax

## expr1[expr2]

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6

## %

- **`Modulo`** (integer remainder). Applicable to numerical expressions.

## Syntax

expr1 % expr2

### Returns

Integer or float value, or series of values.

### Remarks

In Pine Script®, when the integer remainder is calculated, the quotient is truncated, i.e. rounded towards the lowest absolute value. The resulting value will have the same sign as the dividend.

Example: -1 % 9 = -1 - 9 * int(-1/9) = -1 - 9 * int(-0.111) = -1 - 9 * 0 = -1.

## %=

Modulo assignment. Applicable to numerical expressions.

a = 2
b = 3
a += b
// Result: a = 5.
plot(a)
```

### Returns

indicator("`=` showcase")
// The following are all valid variable declarations.
i = 1
MS_IN_ONE_MINUTE = 1000 * 60
showPlotInput = input.bool(true, "Show plots")
pHi = ta.pivothigh(5, 5)
plotColor = color.green
plot(pHi, color = plotColor, display = showPlotInput ? display.all : display.none, precision = i)
==
Equality operator. Returns true if the operands are considered equal, and false otherwise. This operator is compatible with all value types, including "int", "float", "bool", "color", and "string". The operator can also compare two line or label IDs.
Syntax
expr1 == expr2
```

### Returns

Boolean value, or series of boolean values.

### Remarks

This operator rounds "float" operands to nine fractional digits.

## =>

The '=>' operator is used in user-defined function declarations and in switch statements.

The function declaration syntax is:

## Syntax
A <local_block> is zero or more Pine Script® statements.

The <function_result> is a variable, an expression, or a tuple.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("=>")
// single-line function
f1(x, y) => x + y
// multi-line function
f2(x, y) =>
    sum = x + y
    sumChange = ta.change(sum, 10)
    // Function automatically returns the last expression used in it
plot(f1(30, 8) + f2(1, 3))
```

## Annotations

## @description

Sets a custom description for scripts that use the library() declaration statement. The text provided with this annotation will be used to pre-fill the "Description" field in the publication dialogue.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
// @description Provides a tool to quickly output a label on the chart.
library("MyLibrary")
// @function Outputs a label with `labelText` on the bar's high.
// @param labelText (series string) The text to display on the label.
// @returns Drawn label.
export drawLabel(string labelText) =>
    label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
@enum
If placed above an enum declaration, it adds a custom description for the enum. The Pine Editor's autosuggest uses this description and displays it when a user hovers over the enum name. When used in library scripts, the descriptions of all enums using the export keyword will pre-fill the "Description" field in the publication dialogue.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Session highlight", overlay = true)
//@enum       Contains fields with popular timezones as titles.
//@field exch Has an empty string as the title to represent the chart timezone.
enum tz
    utc  = "UTC"
    exch = ""
    ny   = "America/New_York"
    chi  = "America/Chicago"
    lon  = "Europe/London"
    tok  = "Asia/Tokyo"
//@variable The session string.
selectedSession = input.session("1200-1500", "Session")
//@variable The selected timezone. The input's dropdown contains the fields in the `tz` enum.
selectedTimezone = input.enum(tz.utc, "Session Timezone")
//@variable Is `true` if the current bar's time is in the specified session.
bool inSession = false
if not na(time("", selectedSession, str.tostring(selectedTimezone)))
    inSession := true
// Highlight the background when `inSession` is `true`.
bgcolor(inSession ? color.new(color.green, 90) : na, title = "Active session highlight")
@field
If placed above a type or enum declaration, it adds a custom description for a field of the type/enum. After the annotation, users should specify the field name, followed by its description.
The Pine Editor's autosuggest uses this description and displays it when a user hovers over the type/enum or field name. When used in library() scripts, the descriptions of all types/enums using the export keyword will pre-fill the "Description" field in the publication dialogue.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("New high over the last 20 bars", overlay = true)
//@type A point on a chart.
//@field index The index of the bar where the point is located, i.e., its `x` coordinate.
//@field price The price where the point is located, i.e., its `y` coordinate.
type Point
    int index
    float price
//@variable If the current `high` is the highest over the last 20 bars, returns a new `Point` instance, `na` otherwise.
Point highest = na
```

## if ta.highestbars(high, 20) == 0
If placed above a function declaration, it adds a custom description for the function.

The Pine Editor's autosuggest uses this description and displays it when a user hovers over the function name. When used in library() scripts, the descriptions of all functions using the export keyword will pre-fill the "Description" field in the publication dialogue.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
// @description Provides a tool to quickly output a label on the chart.
library("MyLibrary")
// @function Outputs a label with `labelText` on the bar's high.
// @param labelText (series string) The text to display on the label.
// @returns Drawn label.
export drawLabel(string labelText) =>
    label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
@param
If placed above a function declaration, it adds a custom description for a function parameter. After the annotation, users should specify the parameter name, then its description.
The Pine Editor's autosuggest uses this description and displays it when a user hovers over the function name. When used in library() scripts, the descriptions of all functions using the export keyword will pre-fill the "Description" field in the publication dialogue.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
// @description Provides a tool to quickly output a label on the chart.
library("MyLibrary")
// @function Outputs a label with `labelText` on the bar's high.
// @param labelText (series string) The text to display on the label.
// @returns Drawn label.
export drawLabel(string labelText) =>
    label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
@returns
If placed above a function declaration, it adds a custom description for what that function returns.
The Pine Editor's autosuggest uses this description and displays it when a user hovers over the function name. When used in library() scripts, the descriptions of all functions using the export keyword will pre-fill the "Description" field in the publication dialogue.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
// @description Provides a tool to quickly output a label on the chart.
library("MyLibrary")
// @function Outputs a label with `labelText` on the bar's high.
// @param labelText (series string) The text to display on the label.
// @returns Drawn label.
export drawLabel(string labelText) =>
    label.new(bar_index, high, text = labelText)
@strategy_alert_message
If used within a strategy() script, it provides a default message to pre-fill the "Message" field in the alert creation dialogue.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
strategy("My strategy", overlay=true, margin_long=100, margin_short=100)
//@strategy_alert_message Strategy alert on symbol {{ticker}}
longCondition = ta.crossover(ta.sma(close, 14), ta.sma(close, 28))
if (longCondition)
    strategy.entry("My Long Entry Id", strategy.long)
strategy.exit("Exit", "My Long Entry Id", profit = 10 / syminfo.mintick, loss = 10 / syminfo.mintick)
@type
If placed above a type declaration, it adds a custom description for the type.
The Pine Editor's autosuggest uses this description and displays it when a user hovers over the type name. When used in library() scripts, the descriptions of all types using the export keyword will pre-fill the "Description" field in the publication dialogue.
```

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("New high over the last 20 bars", overlay = true)
//@type A point on a chart.
//@field index The index of the bar where the point is located, i.e., its `x` coordinate.
//@field price The price where the point is located, i.e., its `y` coordinate.
type Point
    int index
    float price
//@variable If the current `high` is the highest over the last 20 bars, returns a new `Point` instance, `na` otherwise.
Point highest = na
```

## if ta.highestbars(high, 20) == 0
If placed above a variable declaration, it adds a custom description for the variable.

The Pine Editor's autosuggest uses this description and displays it when a user hovers over the variable name.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("New high over the last 20 bars", overlay = true)
//@type A point on a chart.
//@field index The index of the bar where the point is located, i.e., its `x` coordinate.
//@field price The price where the point is located, i.e., its `y` coordinate.
type Point
    int index
    float price
//@variable If the current `high` is the highest over the last 20 bars, returns a new `Point` instance, `na` otherwise.
Point highest = na
```

## if ta.highestbars(high, 20) == 0
Specifies the Pine Script® version that the script will use. The number in this annotation should not be confused with the script's version number, which updates on every saved change to the code.

### Example

```pinescript
//@version=6
indicator("Pine v6 Indicator")
plot(close)
```

### Example

//This indicator has no version annotation, so it will try to use v1.

//Pine Script® v1 has no function named `indicator()`, so the script will not compile.

## indicator("Pine v1 Indicator")

## plot(close)

### Remarks

The version should always be specified. Otherwise, for compatibility reasons, the script will be compiled using Pine Script® v1, which lacks most of the newer features and is bound to confuse. This annotation can be anywhere within a script, but we recommend placing it at the top of the code for readability.
